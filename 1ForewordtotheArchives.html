				Foreword to the Archives
			</h1>
		</header>

		<section class="inscription">
			<p>Imagine you are poking around in someone's attic, where you discover an old linen trunk, and when you
				open it, you find it is crammed full of notebooks and loose documents &mdash; and some of them look very
				old. You read a few of those on top, or read at them, just to see what they are about, and begin to
				wonder how they might be connected: sometimes you perceive a link here and there &mdash; a name appears
				in more than one writing, maybe, or now and then some dates seem to line up &mdash; but most of the
				individual texts are just that: singletons that don't relate to each other at all, or not that you can
				see, so far...</p>
			<p>But, you reflect, they all ended up here, together like this; how did that happen? because of course
				every writing has another story in addition to the one it tells: how did it get from the author to you?
				Tracing that second story back to its source, you realize that of course there's a third story to be
				discovered, or discerned: how did this document come to be composed in the first place? how does it fit
				in with the story of the author's life? <a id="noendofstories">And so on: as the Remnant say</a>,
				<!--<a href="ScholarsApologyredux.html#noendofstories">-->no end of stories and their stories</a>.
			</p>
			<p>One of the many pleasures of exploring an archive takes place at the very beginning, before you have any
				comprehension of its overall structure or extent. In that moment, every new thing you discover is itself
				alone, you know nothing about it to begin with except what it says about itself, <a
					id="astepinanydirection">you don't know where to go when you finish reading it</a>, but it feels
				like <!--<a href="EgderusLastWritings.html#astepinanydirection">-->every step you take, in whatever
				direction, is progress</a>.</p>
			<p>After a while, an impression of context begins to emerge: you now perceive a writing as being in among
				other writings, whose only connection at first was that you were reading them, but you start to feel
				them talking to each other, if only in your recollection of them, so you go back and reread this one,
				then that one &mdash; and you start to perceive structure as well as content, how they resemble each
				other, or differ in this or that respect. At this point <!--<a id="somethingrightandbright">-->the pure
				experience which Egderus describes</a> as reading
				'<!--<a href="Thescriptorandhisbeloved.html#somethingrightandbright">-->something bright and right and
				beautiful for the first time</a>' gives over, more and more, to the forensic activities of the
				investigator, which of course have their own pleasures, but they are quite distinct.</p>
			<p>One gets to know a person in just this way, is it not so? And so, you are invited into the company of
				just these persons, whose writings address you, whom they imagined, and longed for enough to tell just
				these stories, in just this way, and for whom they have waited until now, when you appeared, just as
				they hoped you would.</p>
			<p>Again and again, welcome.</p>
