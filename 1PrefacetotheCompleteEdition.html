				Preface to the Complete Edition

			<p>The hypertext rendering of this Complete Edition of Archives Pertaining to Egderus Scriptor took shape
				over the course of a generation, and comprises writings gathered and transmitted over a span many times
				that long. Here collected in one volume are all the texts previously issued in three separate volumes
				published under the title <cite>We Descend</cite>.</p>
			<p>Those previous selections from the Archives were rendered into hypertext form by Bill Bly, the current
				Curator. Volume One was published EV 1997 as a standalone computer application distributed by <a
					href="https://www.eastgate.com/catalog/WeDescend.html">Eastgate Systems</a>; Volume Two was brought
				out in the online journal <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/journals/newriver/17Fall/index.html">The New
					River, Fall 2017</a>. In addition, a 'preliminary view' of Volume Three appeared in <a
					href="http://thenewriver.us/we-descend">The New River, Fall 2019</a>. The edition you are reading
				now presents Volume Three in full, and <a id="heretoforeunpublished">includes a number of Writings</a>
				<a href="1heretoforeunpublished.html#note">heretofore unpublished</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Over the course of this project, the process of preparing the Writings has matured, with the inevitable
				consequence that some inconsistencies appeared not only in the narratives of certain Authors, but also
				in the apparatus in which they were housed. This omnibus edition attempts to smooth out that unevenness,
				though some irregularities were felt to be part of their story, and were retained.</p>
			<p>In any archive of writings, many voices speak, and it can take some time to come to discern how they are
				related to one another. The simplest way to embark on the present journey is to follow the PATHWAY,
				which departs from the word 'Begin' on the <a href="1TITLE.html">TITLE</a> page; this procedure will
				take you through twenty-one Writings of varying length. <!--The <a href="1PATHWAY.html">-->PATHWAY</a>
				constitutes a tour of the Writings that will introduce you to most of the persons in this volume of We
				Descend and some of their stories. At the PATHWAY's end, you will arrive at an interstitial directory
				called the <!--<a href="LANDING.html"><strong>-->LANDING</strong></a>, displaying links to Writings you
				have not yet seen, <!--to the <a href="INVENTORY.html">INVENTORY</a> (a list of Authors), -->and to
				other apparati that will be useful in exploring the Archives further.</p>
			<p>At the bottom of each text field, activate the link '&mdash; on >>' to go to the next Writing along the
				PATHWAY, and '<< back &mdash;' to retrace your steps. (Note that employing the directional controls on
					your reading device may have a different effect.) Activating the 'PATHWAY' link that sits between
					these two in the navigation bar will show you a list of all of the Writings in this introductory
					sequence.</p>
					<!--<h4>About links in this edition</h4>
			<p>In contrast to items in a linkList or the navigationLinks at the bottom of every page, links in the body of a Writing generally work on a semantic basis &mdash; that is, a differently colored word or phrase links to a separate Writing, as you might expect; when you arrive, a phrase will appear highlighted for a moment to help you find your place. Nearby will be a related phrase with a colores link to help you return from whence you came.</p>
			<p>However, where you encounter a link in <a href="boldfacetype.html">boldface type</a>, that link works <em>one-way only</em>; to return from wherever it leads, you will need to use the directional control on your reading device.</p>-->
					<p>[TECHNICAL NOTE: Longer Writings, like this Preface, which might extend beyond one screenful of
						text, <a id="movingthetextitself">will appear in multiple columns, as in an ancient scroll</a>,
						and may be read by <a href="1movingthetextitself.html#note">moving the text itself</a> left or
						right. However, for the sake of readability, lists and other apparati are displayed in a single
						column that can be shifted up and down.]</p>
