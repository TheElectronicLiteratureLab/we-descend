			<p>As with Egderus, I start <!--<a href="secrets.html">-->this hidden writing</a> in secret, since it is unlikely to be found among so much foliage from other trees. I have no hope of escaping detection much longer, since my master has started asking me about the archive &mdash; is it safe, he wants to know. So far I've been able to reassure him, but the last time I may have overplayed my attempt at breezy reassurance. A flicker in his eye, a tensing of the brow &mdash; it may be nothing; he is so anxious about other things &mdash; but if I am right, the next time he comes he will ask to see what I am working on. I need a decoy, something I have yet to put my mind to...</p>
			<p>I know he loves me and, in his hapless way, wants the best for me. But he is under compulsion himself, and I surmise it regards the archive, perhaps only as part of a larger concern among his superiors, who themselves may be under pressure from their own masters. I cannot fathom what that concern might be, but I do know that I am the one least likely to survive any major upheaval. Indeed, I may be sacrificed early in order to stave off just such a disruption, and I imagine my master, whom I know so well, is terribly worried about the same thing &mdash; if not for my sake, then for his own: dear man that he is, he is too weak to be able to protect these writings from the very people indicted herein.</p>
			<p>Enough preamble. I have been making a copy of every writing in the archive, and until now supplying each with as much as I could deduce about its author, the intention in writing it, and the circumstances under which it was produced. This is very toilsome, of course, and a great deal of this adminicular labor requires guessing, at which I am a poor practitioner. The resulting documentum is becoming unwieldy, both in its ideational complexity and its physical cumbersomeness: notae must be inserted into the text of my copy (<!--<a href="LegomenonforUNKNOWNCURATOR.html">-->in a different script, to signify that they are notae</a>) or, in the case of an afterthought, attached by means of some device to the writing itself. Should I have to leave in haste, I can only dump everything pell-mell into a not very commodious bag I have reserved for the purpose.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, the work proceeds, though the pace has necessarily slowed since I arrived at the commentary supplied by one of my predecessors, because I now must deal not only with the writing as a Writing, but also with the annotation system, which I must say is not entirely systematic.</p>
			<p>But then my predecessor too was operating in stressful conditions &mdash; though it seems that at first it was the stress of joyful excitement at making this discovery under the very noses of the wise men of the time.</p>
			<p>However, I anticipate &mdash; it is easy to be drawn off the path into the enchantment of a particular story, and the archive is rich in such temptations.</p>
			<p>My plan is to <!--<a href="heavilydamageddocument.html">-->finish copying</a> the primary Writings and then find a safe place to hide them &mdash; in fact, I think I may transfer the Writings I have already finished, in case</p>
