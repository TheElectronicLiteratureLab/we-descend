			<p>According to the Remnant, <a id="astepinanydirection">'When you do not know where to turn</a>, <a
					href="ForewordtotheArchives.html#astepinanydirection">a step in any direction is progress</a>.'</p>
			<p>When I began, I hoped I would be able to continue these recollections at leisure; there are many people
				who cared for and inspired me, and I would like to do proper honor to their memory. But my time is
				short. I must press on and finish this testament.</p>
			<p>My friend the Historian had been tortured for <a id="braggartanddrunkard">more than he knew, or let on
					that he knew</a>. <a href="HistoriansNotebook.html#braggartanddrunkard">In his own mind, he was
					simply a braggart and a drunkard</a> who had opened his mouth once too often. But even he must have
				wondered at the avidity of the Good Doctor's attentions &mdash; what evil did the Good Doctor believe he
				was rooting out?</p>
			<p>Of course he never explained it to me, and the interrogation was cut short by the Historian's escape
				before the Good Doctor could get what he was after. But <a id="puttingthisincidenttogether">I have
					meditated on this mystery over the long years</a>, and &mdash; <a
					href="puttingthisincidenttogether.html#note">putting this incident together</a> with others that
				have taken place since &mdash; I have come to a provisional explanation.</p>
			<p>I do not know what the Historian's actual convictions were concerning the Ancients, but the Good Doctor
				without question was convinced he was a heretic. Almost all of the clients of the Office of Inquiry were
				being held for some impious act or statement &mdash; and at the time the penalty for false belief was
				death, once the Examiner had persuaded the client to confess.</p>
			<p>The Good Doctor would never himself have bothered with a simple case of impiety. And no one would have
				believed the Historian's assertion to be a childhood friend of the Golias, so <a
					id="BythetimetheGoodDoctortookover">it is doubtful that it was this claim that made him important to
					the Good Doctor</a>. <a href="BythetimetheGoodDoctortookover.html#note">By the time the Good Doctor
					took over</a> the interrogation, the issue had ceased to come up &mdash; the Historian attempted to
				invoke this alleged friendship early on, but apparently gave up, seeing that it had no effect.</p>
			<p><a id="unlawfulFellowship">There had been rumors about an unlawful Fellowship</a> that preached an
				outrageous doctrine concerning the Ancients: that they were not gods at all, but rather plain human
				beings like us: people, not deities, who had mysteriously destroyed themselves, and that our puny towns
				and fortresses are built upon &mdash; indeed, fashioned from &mdash; the residuum of their unimaginably
				glorious but wholly mortal civilization. Reportedly the motto or creed of this apostate cult consisted
				of seven syllables in a strange language: sub-ob-scu-ram-er-at-lux, which was supposed to mean 'beneath
				darkness, there was light' or some such absurdity. No one I knew believed that there ever was such a
				Fellowship; the more cynical among the scriptores proposed that the whole story was concocted by the
				Examiners, as an embellishment on the cruelty that gave meaning to their lives.</p>
			<p>Or so I thought at the time, and for long afterwards. In my youthful affections, the Good Doctor was
				simply evil, and my beautiful Historian his entirely innocent victim. I do not remember encountering the
				nonsense phrase in my readings of his previous sessions with other Examiners', but then I wasn't looking
				for it; most likely he never uttered it, because he had never heard of it. But I now believe that my
				master was convinced that the Historian was a bona fide apostle of this Fellowship, and the purpose of
				the interrogation was to get what the Good Doctor imagined was real information on its activities and
				the whereabouts of more false prophets like him.</p>
			<p>I repeat that I do not know if the Historian was in fact a member of this Fellowship, if it existed at
				all. And <a id="Ofmyownconvictions">the Good Doctor never found out, at least not from the
					Historian</a>. <a href="Ofmyownconvictions.html#note">Of my own convictions</a> in the matter, <a
					id="TheGoodDoctorhimselfdisappeared">I may say more later, if there is time</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="TheGoodDoctorhimselfdisappeared.html#note">The Good Doctor himself disappeared</a>, under
				circumstances that remain unclear to me. I am fairly certain that my being returned to Mountain House
				was an indirect consequence of the purge which the Golias subsequently effected upon the Office of
				Inquiry. The Remnant say, 'The evil of today is tomorrow's good fortune,' and my life gives proof to the
				saying. <a id="todaytomorrow">And to its companion adage as well</a>: '<a
					href="HistoriansTale.html#todaytomorrow">Today's joy will break your heart tomorrow</a>.' For my
				dear Historian repaid my helping him escape by getting himself killed coming back to me so many years
				later. And his death in my arms proved to be only <a id="Whyowhy">the beginning of my heart's agony</a>.
			</p>
			<p><a href="EgderusandtheHistorian.html#Whyowhy">Why O why</a> <a id="stealtreasure">did he steal</a> <a
					href="HistoriansTale.html#stealtreasure">his benefactors' treasure</a>? For what possible benefit
				could he hope to exchange it? Surely he must have known they would come after him to get it back? And
				that this would result in <a id="childrenoftheAncients">their utter extinction, after so many
					generations</a>, these <a href="childrenoftheAncients.html#note">children of the Ancients</a>
				themselves?</p>
			<p>I cannot understand what he was thinking. What I am capable of understanding is that he may not have been
				thinking at all, that once he realized how precious the box was he simply snatched it and ran &mdash; he
				had no plan, not even a motive. That is how we are. I must believe that this is what happened: it simply
				happened. As the Remnant say, 'To question too deeply is to find the evil you fear'.</p>
			<p><a id="theannalsoftheGolias">The carnage that ensued is completely documented</a> in <a
					href="theannalsoftheGolias.html#note">the annals of the Golias</a>, and I am thankful that I need
				not recapitulate it here. But once again, <a id="woundedanddying">the evil of that day became the good
					fortune of another</a>: <a href="torrential.html#woundedanddying">at Mountain House we tended the
					wounded and eased the dying out of this life</a>; afterwards I persuaded the Golias to let me
				continue this service to the hopelessly afflicted from all places. It has provided a purpose for an
				otherwise empty life.</p>
			<p>Yet I remain uneasy in spirit. My heart will never cease to grieve for those meaninglessly slain: my
				mentor the Superius Frater, my Historian, his benefactors, the soldiers of the Golias who were murdered
				for following their orders to murder. I was responsible for setting this evil in motion, though I cannot
				imagine doing other than I did, given what I knew, what I could not have known, what my own pride had
				not yet been sufficiently broken to permit me to learn. <a id="Aricswarning">I accomplished my imagined
					revenge upon the Good Doctor</a>, and <a href="RescuePlot.html#Aricswarning">weep when I remember
					Aric's attempt to warn me of its consequences</a>.</p>
			<p><a id="Iopenmyarmstoitscoldembrace">Now my recompense is near</a>. <a
					href="Iopenmyarmstoitscoldembrace.html#note">I open my arms to its cold embrace</a>....</p>
