			<p>My friends, listen to me. We are always surprised when we meet one another, when we say something and
				find ourselves understood, because from our earliest days we were taught that we are no different from
				the others, that no person is better than any other. But we are not the same as others, we are different
				from most of the people we meet, for they do not understand what we say, even though they say that they
				do, and it is clear that they believe what they say. We have spent most of our lives alone among such
				people, and we adopt strategies for coping with the discrepancy between what we understand and what the
				others plainly do not.</p>
			<p>We say to ourselves that we must be missing something, and to try to figure out what it is we do not see
				that causes this misunderstanding. We try to explain ourselves, in order to help the others to see not
				just what we see, but what is there, and they become offended by what they call our condescending tone.
				We then assume we must be wrong, since everyone else disagrees, and <a id="spiritbreaks">we lose our
					courage</a>, <a href="intheKeep.html#spiritbreaks">our spirit breaks</a>, and misery and despair
				follow.</p>
			<p>Then one day we meet one who does understand, and we are staggered. We recognize each other, and love one
				another on the instant, and bind ourselves to one another forever; but beyond that we do not know what
				to do. For the world is in the power of the others, and this new confirmation is dangerous, for the
				others hate those different from themselves, and their hatred and wrath is terrible.</p>
			<p>But our power is not the power of force, which is their power; our knowledge is not the knowledge of
				indoctrination, which is their knowledge, it is the wisdom of experience; our understanding is not the
				cunning of the predator, which is their understanding, it is the vision of the seer.</p>
			<p>They are jealous and spiteful, we are generous and kind; they are vanglorious and selfish, we are modest
				and compassionate; they are wrong, we are right. They own the world, we are the bearers of life.</p>
