			<p>...The house sprawled around the end of the lake, which itself nestled in a cleft between the two spikes
				which topped the mountain. It was difficult to imagine what it had been used for prior to its earliest
				known function as a hill fortress &mdash; its design was much too exposed. The oldest section of the
				house, right on the point of the lake where it drained off into the steep cleft between the horns,
				contained a number of very large halls, each with more than one fireplace. This section, three stories
				high, was covered by a steep peaked roof and capped by a tower. Under the peak ran a long corridor with
				rooms opening off it on either side, <a id="theFraterhimself">which served as the dormitory for all</a>
				but <a href="theFraterhimself.html#note">the Frater himself</a>, whose quarters were in the tower.</p>
			<p>Beneath this dormitory floor was the balcony overlooking a room known inexplicably as the Parlor, a huge
				open two-story auditorium which could have been used for large public meetings or entertainments.
				Directly beneath the Parlor was the refectory, a dark, low-ceilinged expanse with long tables and
				numerous alcoves. In this refectory, as one faced the lake, along the right wall was the Frater's
				library, screened off by heavy wood paneling inset with translucent glass windows. The Frater's study
				could be entered through a door on the lake end of this small library. Outside, the lower porch made an
				ell around the left and lake sides of the refectory; the upper porch ran along the three outward sides
				of the Parlor above.</p>
			<p>Set behind the refectory was the entrance hall, low and wide but not very deep, which was dominated by a
				huge ornate staircase, wide enough to drive a team of horses easily between its railings. This stairway
				led up to the Parlor, the balcony, and the dormitory. <a id="cellarbeneaththeentry">Beneath the entry
					was a cellar of uncertain proportions</a>, which could only be reached by an ill-kept and rickety
				stairway hidden beneath a heavy table in the Frater's library (study?).</p>
			<p>To the left and right were the ruins of what must have been a magnificent residence or, perhaps, a very
				well-appointed garrison. As one faced the lake, the left or north-east wing, which had been made of
				wood, looked like a long burial mound with the rotted stumps of planks and beams sticking out here and
				there. The right or south-west wing had been made of stone, and a few stretches of wall still remained
				standing, along with the shadowy outline of rooms approximately equal in size to those in the dormitory.
				Access to both wings had long ago been walled off by stones from the collapsed south-west wing.</p>
			<p>Behind and down the hill from the house were scattered the foundations of outbuildings, all in ruins,
				with no hint of what their purpose might have been, although one or two of them must have been used for
				stables and barns.</p>
			<p>The mountain itself, as has been said, continued upward on either side of the lake, terminating in two
				cliffs at the end opposite the house. Atop the cliff to the south-east was a ruined tower. The other, on
				the north-east, had no structure upon it. Both commanded views of the entire mountain and all of its
				approaches, the south-east cliff to the south and west, the other to the north and east. The only easy
				approach was from the east, where the town hunched in the valley below. It was possible to gain the
				lower reaches of the mountain from almost any direction, but no way to get near the plateau of the lake
				and house other than by way of the main road, unless one scaled impossible heights to approach the lake
				from the opposite side, right under the eyes of the lookouts on the twin cliffs.</p>
