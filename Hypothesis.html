			<p>[<a href="TheScholarisdead.html#note">The Scholar is dead</a>, Egderus is dead, the Ancients are dead, all of us, sooner or later, long dead. Long beyond caring.]</p>
			<p>It is no accident that we call a person's writings a body of work, a corpus. The literary remains. The left-behinds of a wonderful picnic, cut short by a sudden squall: the gleaners come, pick through the trash, covetous, hoarding, so soon to be picked through themselves.</p>
			<p>Our putative author is one such temporarily able-bodied seeker. Throughout this exercise he has operated on the bread-crumb or skein-of-yarn principle, that down there (in his formulation) is a gate (trap-door?) through which we have passed (risen?) from one plenteousness into another. From throbbing dark magnificence into blinding freezing light, for example.</p>
			<p>But the maelstrom disappears when the sea calms. Even if you could reconvene the tornado, would that help to put your house back together?</p>
			<p>No. You put up a new house. And build the bones of your ancestors into the foundation.</p>
