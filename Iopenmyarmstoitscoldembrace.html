			<p>No one has discovered how Egderus died, whether of natural or unnatural causes, and if the latter,
				whether he knew the means or agent of his death beforehand.</p>
			<p>There remains but one final selection from the writings of Egderus, one which he himself wished to make
				difficult to find (for reasons he does not explain), and I have acceded to that wish by not including
				its title in the Inventory. However, having found this note, Dear ourReader, you have demonstrated that
				you are the 'persistent stalker' Egderus intended to find this writing, which may be accessed by
				following <a href="EgderusSecret.html"><strong>this link</strong></a>.</p>
