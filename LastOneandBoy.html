			<p>There's a boy here now.</p>
			<p>He's young, 5 or 6. Beaten up badly &mdash; fall or fight, hard to tell. He won't talk; who knows what
				he's seen?</p>
			<p>My sense is it was the cold brought him to me, but, though he follows me everywhere, he won't let me near
				him, bolts right away if I even head in his direction [margin note: gone for hours], &amp; he screeches
				something awful if I speak to him.</p>
			<p>So I let him be, leave him food here &amp; there, &amp; go about my business. I've had to give up talking
				to myself, though, when he's around.</p>
			<p>It distresses him so; I think it's the sound more than anything, because even when he's screaming, he
				claps his hands over his ears <a id="insert">as if to shut out the noise</a>.</p>
			<blockquote><a href="insert.html#note">[insert] >></a><br>
				He won't let me touch him, but once in a while he'll reach out &amp; tap me with a stick or something.
				Yesterday I took hold of a long stalk he was pointing at me, &amp; he let me hold it a moment before
				dropping his end &amp; sprinting away << </blockquote>
					<p>He wasn't with the others when I left them &amp; came here; all I can think is that he must've
						been caught outside. Hard to believe anyone could've survived that; possibly his story's even
						stranger than I can imagine.</p>
					&nbsp;
					<p>What made me leave the House was them standing in a circle, holding hands, heads bowed. I can't
						tell you why that public posture revolted me so, but it did, especially when suddenly assumed by
						a group who up until that moment had been behaving like ordinary people. Part of it, I think, is
						it looks showy to me; part is also its blatant lack of sense; but worst of all is its waste of
						concentration, when there's so much work to be done.</p>
					<p><a id="nothingtobedone">Then I remembered</a>: there's <a
							href="keepingbusy.html#nothingtobedone">nothing to be done</a>. So it makes no difference.
						Does no good, maybe &mdash; but, maybe, does no harm neither. If they feel better, let them go
						ahead.</p>
					<p>But not in front of me &mdash; makes my skin crawl. So for this among many much better reasons,
						I'm making camp out here.</p>
					&nbsp;
					<blockquote>Last night for the first time he fell asleep in front of me. I wasn't exactly paying
						attention &mdash; just staring into the embers, probably dozing myself. One minute his eyes are
						fixed on me across the flames; next time I look up they're closed (rather hooded), and <a
							id="dreamingdog">his hands &amp; face are twitching</a>, <a
							href="refugee.html#dreamingdog">like a dog hunting through his dreams</a>, or more likely
						the squirrel the dog is hunting.</blockquote>
					&nbsp;
					<p>I went back to the House today, for some reason, and everyone is gone. The place is utterly
						empty. It's possible, I guess, that they've left on a trek somewhere, maybe to look for others
						like themselves, if there are any.</p>
					<p>I could keep things going here &mdash; the boy &amp; I've become accustomed to each other &mdash;
						but it's getting cold, and when the first snow hits I'm pretty sure I'd rather be watching a
						fire in one o' them fine rooms than scrabbling for sticks out here in the woods. I bet there's
						food left there, too, in places the others maybe didn't think to look.</p>
					<p>The boy'll be a problem, though. What do I do? He's taken to following me when I gather wood or
						check the traps &mdash; as long as I don't go near the House. As soon as I get even close he
						just vanishes, &amp; I'll find him back here at camp when I return. (Or not &mdash; he's a very
						independent person.) He trusts me now enough to sleep mostly through the night, but I don't know
						what he'll think or do if I 'abandon' him to go live in the House. I could try to do it
						gradually, just move camp a little closer bit by bit, <a id="smellsnow">but there just isn't
							time</a> &mdash; <a href="EgderusandtheHistorian.html#smellsnow">snow's coming, I can smell
							it</a>.</p>
					<p>Of course, he can, too, I'd bet.</p>
					&nbsp;
					<p>[What follows seems to be a transcription, either of spoken words or some kind of recording of
						them. Ellipses apparently indicate pauses in speaking, not lacunae in the text. All editorial
						marks are in the original.]</p>
					<blockquote>And so I started... to try to tell him... what|how I thought|think had|it happened.
						&lt;inaudible&gt;... For some time... I'd been seeing... &lt;splice&gt; mad, crazy, like
						insects, almost &mdash; racing, running everywhere, never just walking &mdash; speed, riding,
						skating, shoving their &lt;kids&gt; along &lt;in wagons? carts?&gt; with huge wheels for
						stability... &lt;weights?&gt; in their hands, like &lt;torture?&gt;<br>
						[Long blank]... falling, crashing to the ground... I don't think... it was the calamity... we
						all expected... just... unravel &mdash; &lt;breaks off&gt;<br>
						[2nd? fragment] I was seeing it through their eyes. Someone will see it. It will happen... &lt;
						&mdash; &gt; countless generations... see this, through my eyes... I am the vessel, the
						&lt;wagon? cart?&gt; for their seeing, their &lt;conveyance&gt;, but those other... countless
						generations... I will see... through their eyes... they... will bear me &mdash; this &mdash;
						then. That's what I saw... &lt;long pause&gt; &lt;inaudible&gt; &lt;end&gt;</blockquote>
