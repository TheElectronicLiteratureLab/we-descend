			<p>Aric is first mentioned in the Archives as one of the co-conspirators <a id="conspired">in the so-called
					'Rescue Plot'</a> that <a href="LegomenonforHISTORIAN.html#conspired">freed the Historian and
					disgraced the Good Doctor</a>. </p>
			<p><a id="TestimonyofPraetorAric">The Writing</a> {<a href="TestimonyofPraetorAric.html">Testimony of
					Praetor Aric</a>} is a transcript, either in deposition or in open court, given during the
				investigation into the affair. It follows the traditional format of a scriptor's 'realization', wherein
				only the utterances of the interview subject are recorded &mdash; but, as in most realizations, the
				interlocutor's questions are not difficult to infer.</p>
			<p>Later, <a id="AricAftermath">in the epistolary</a> {<a href="AricAftermath.html">Aric: Aftermath</a>},
				Aric describes to Egderus what really happened when his commander Robenc confronted the Good Doctor at
				the latter's lodgings.</p>
			<p><a id="PostscriptinAricsownhand">According to the problematic</a> {<a
					href="PostscriptinAricsownhand.html">Postscript in Aric's own hand</a>} found among the Last
				Writings of <a href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus</strong></a>, it was Aric who carried out
				the assassination of the <a href="LegomenonforSUPERIUSFRATER.html"><strong>8th Superius Frater of
						Mountain House</strong></a>, Egderus' mentor and predecessor in that office &mdash; the
				motivation of which remains a mystery.</p>
			<p>There is also ambiguous evidence in The Missionary's Writings that implicate Aric as <a
					href="intheKeep.html#spiritbreaks"><strong>the man who broke his spirit</strong></a> <a
					id="roadtoconversion">and set him</a> <a href="intheKeep.html#roadtoconversion">on the road to
					conversion</a>.</p>
