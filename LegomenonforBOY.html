			<p><a id="return">The narrator of</a> {<a href="return.html">return</a>} is almost certainly the Boy
				described in the Writings of the curmudgeonly philosopher who calls himself the <a

				in the immediate aftermath of the calamity that destroyed the world of the Ancients.</p>
			<p><a id="makingthisup">A separate Writing found with it</a>, {<a href="makingthisup.html">making this

				way they could be known outside the time and place of their occurrence requires the use not only of
				memory &mdash; unreliable at best in retrieving past events into present time &mdash; but text, about
				which the cantankerous Last One is quite blunt in his critique: <a href="enemy.html"><strong>Text is the
						enemy.</a> </strong></p>
			<p>As elsewhere, but particularly in the oldest Writings in the Archives, the generous use of ellipses (...)
				in these evident transcriptions could be a sign that they were originally dictations, where the
				inscriber wished to indicate a pause during which the speaker weighed what to say next, or else just a
				moment when thought trailed off...</p>
