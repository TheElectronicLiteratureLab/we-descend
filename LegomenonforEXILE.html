			<p>The whole of this Author's 'story' is difficult to establish with any certainty: no external clue has yet
				been found to definitively link him to any other person in the Archives (with the obvious &mdash; but
				unverified &mdash; exception of the Author of {<a href="purpleberries.html"><strong>purple
						berries</strong></a>}), and the overall narrative roughed out by this clutch of fragmentary
				Writings proffers only tantalizing hints. </p>
			<p>As elsewhere, however, this has not prevented &mdash; indeed it has certainly inspired &mdash; extensive
				theorization, about where he fled from, where he fled to, what precipitated his flight, and, most
				mysterious of all, how his Writings came to be part of the Archives Pertaining to Egderus Scriptor at
				all.</p>
			<p>One of the most tenacious theories links the Author here called the Exile with the Writing {<a
					href="thiswork.html"><strong>this work</strong></a>}, most often attributed to <a
					href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus</strong></a> &mdash; the hypothesis being that this
				person was one of the <a href="LegomenonforINSURGENT.html"><strong>band of insurgents</strong></a>
				mentioned in that Writing who are about to leave on <a href="thiswork.html#actsofinterference"><strong>a
						mission to 'carry out acts of interference' against 'the enemy'</strong></a>, a powerful figure
				tyrannizing the world, or so he is described there. Presumably, in this postulation, these acts of
				resistance were unsuccessful, and the Exile was forced to flee alone, perhaps the only survivor of the
				expedition. </p>
			<p>However, the fragmentary profile provided by the Exile's Writings could fit any number of similar
				scenarios, including a more recent theory (preferred here) that <a id="annihilatedtheTemple">places him
					among the 'terrorists'</a> who <a href="conspiracy.html#annihilatedtheTemple">brought down the
					Temple</a> during the Scholar's time, generations after Egderus. </p>
			<p>Although this latter story line presents fewer problems, it affords no more concrete evidence to support
				its surmises than any other. </p>
			<p>The sequence in which these Writings are here presented is speculative, of course, but it does seem to
				make general sense on the basis of internal evidence.</p>
			<p><a id="fog">The first Writing</a>, {<a href="fog.html">fog</a>} sketches in the Exile's situation:
				escaping capture, he has, after a long and arduous flight, found temporary haven in a foreign town, a
				stranger who knows nothing of the local language or customs, but nontheless feels safe, at least for the
				time being.</p>
			<p><a id="drawn">The lyrical</a> {<a href="drawn.html">drawn</a>} describes how the Exile's day begins, and
				the ambivalence he feels about being pulled into the town's life: even though he knows no one and no one
				knows him, for the moment at least, he still feels that he might be a danger to the community in which
				he has found temporary refuge...</p>
			<p><a id="stars">In the next Writing</a>, {<a href="stars.html">stars</a>}, the Exile remembers with
				fondness and longing his early adventures in a large city where he made a life as a performing artist...
			</p>
			<p><a id="fire">But an unexpected</a> {<a href="fire.html">fire</a>} breaks out in the town, and the Exile
				becomes involved, against his will, for he fears 'discovery' by (or through) his engagement in this
				emergency...</p>
			<p><a id="place">Then, in</a> {<a href="place.html">place</a>}, he witnesses a traditional ceremony that
				re-enacts another search for refuge... </p>
			<p><a id="ManhunterMoon">Eventually, in</a> {<a href="ManhunterMoon.html">Manhunter Moon</a>} the Exile is
				welcomed tentatively into his community, causing him to offer up a kind of prayer of thanksgiving. </p>
			<p>Soon, however &mdash; as he foresaw from the beginning &mdash; his sanctuary is wrecked, most likely by
				his pursuers, <a id="attack">as recounted in</a> {<a href="attack.html">attack</a>}. But he is able to
				aid a small number of his new companions to escape, among whom <a id="grandmother">he forms an odd
					friendship</a>, with the {<a href="grandmother.html">grandmother</a>} or elder of the group, who
				reappears briefly in the last extant Writing of the Exile, <a id="flight">the tragic</a> {<a
					href="flight.html">flight</a>} &mdash; and may figure in the possibly related story {<a
					href="purpleberries.html"><strong>purple berries</strong></a>}, a supposition addressed in its
				proper place, the {<a href="LegomenonforSOLDIER.html"><strong>Legomenon for SOLDIER</strong></a>}. </p>
