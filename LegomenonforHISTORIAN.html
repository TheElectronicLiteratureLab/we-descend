			<p>This oddly-named person appears as a character (or at least a referent) in numerous other Writings &mdash; by <a href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus</strong></a>, <a href="LegomenonforARIC.html"><strong>Aric</strong></a>, the mysterious <a href="LegomenonforMISSIONARY.html"><strong>Missionary</strong></a>, and even the <a href="LegomenonforSCHOLAR.html"><strong>Scholar</strong></a> who curated most if not all of the others' Writings generations later.</p>
			<p>This phenomenon has made it possible to work out a more complete (if still speculative) chronology of the Historian's life than can be done for almost any other figure in the Archives:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As a young man, the Historian was (for a time, at least) the favorite of the (or a) son of the Golias who ruled in Egderus' youth, and it was during this period that he <a href="WritingsofTheMissionary.html#hisHistorian"><strong>met and debated the Missionary</strong></a>;</li>
				<li>Later, he somehow fell foul of the Office of Inquiry, and was <a href="MPart2.html#formeropponent"><strong>imprisoned and tortured by the Good Doctor</strong></a> during the period <a href="EgderusandtheGoodDoctor.html#knownonlyastheHistorian"><strong>when Egderus served as the latter's scriptor</strong></a>;</li>
				<li><a id="conspired">Egderus, Aric, and Aric's commander, Robenc</a>, <a href="LegomenonforARIC.html#conspired">conspired to free the Historian</a> <a id="RobencvsGoodDoctor">(each for a different reason)</a> by <a href="AricAftermath.html#RobencvsGoodDoctor">bringing down the Good Doctor</a>;</li>
				<li>In his flight from the city, the Historian <a id="tookrefuge">took refuge in the mountains</a>, where <a href="LegomenonforROMANTICIMPULSEWRITINGS.html#tookrefuge">he was rescued by a small group of apparently aboriginal people</a>, possibly members of <a href="LegomenonfortheRemnant.html"><strong>the so-called Remnant</strong></a>, from whom he later carried off a box containing sacred artifacts, as he recounts <a id="stealtreasure">in his 'deathbed' confession</a>, transcribed in {<a href="HistoriansTale.html#stealtreasure">Historian's Tale</a>}. The theft set in motion a calamitous sequence of events that resulted not only in his own death, but in <a id="vengefulpursuit">the total extermination of his erstwhile rescuers</a>, as <a href="lacuna.html#vengefulpursuit">a consequence of their vengeful pursuit</a> of him into the domain of the Golias;</li>
				<li>This box, along with his Notebook, was recovered by Egderus and his scriptor <a href="AfterwordTransmissionoftheArchives.html#CuratorMarkito"><strong>Markito</strong></a>, <a id="recovered">as described in</a> {<a href="EgderusandtheHistorian.html#recovered">Egderus and the Historian</a>}. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <a id="HistoriansNotebook">artifact from which the text of</a> {<a href="HistoriansNotebook.html">Historian's Notebook</a>} was originally extracted of course no longer exists, but <a id="notebookdescription">it is described within its own pages</a> as<a href="HistoriansNotebook.html#notebookdescription"> a kind of writing kit given him by his hosts</a>, made of stiff sheets of cured skin or bark upon which he scratched letters with a stylus, which we can imagine was fashioned from a sharpened stick or shard of bone.</p>
			<p>Many commentators &mdash; the Scholar first among them &mdash; have found this Writing implausible enough to prompt skepticism about the Archives as a whole, <a id="convenient">given the Notebook's complex (some would say</a> <a href="LegomenonforMISSIONARY.html#convenient">overly convenient</a>) intertwingling with so many other stories told therein.</p>
			<p>But there is <a id="pyrrhonism">a countercurrent of opinion that regards this kind</a> of <a href="pyrrhonism.html#note">pyrrhonism</a> as mere literary snobbery, and admires the lyrical quality of the Notebook's portrait of an autochthonous people transmitting <a id="factuality">a deeper truth about the Remnant &mdash; and the entire culture of Egderus' time</a> &mdash; <a href="theghosts.html#factuality">than can necessarily be 'proved' by mere evidentiary factuality</a>.</p>
			<p>Finally, <a id="allfalldown">the attribution of</a> {<a href="allfalldown.html">all fall down</a>} to the Historian is perhaps tenuous, though of long standing, despite its evident resemblance to the thought and perspective of that Ancient critic, the <a href="LegomenonforLASTONE.html"><strong>Last One</strong></a>.</p>
