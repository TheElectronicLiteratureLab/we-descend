			<p>Near the end of his tenure as Superius Frater of Mountain House, <a
					href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus Scriptor</strong></a>, the founder of the Archives,
				was required to contend with an unexpected crisis: the urgent necessity to repurpose his home, for
				generations an eremitic retreat for persons wishing to withdraw from worldly concerns, into a refuge for
				survivors of a genocidal campaign which twice engulfed that very world. In the latter case, part of that
				redirection in the Mission of his order entailed giving reluctant blessing to a group of his charges
				bent on acts of resistance against 'the enemy', an autocratic warlord bent on world domination (or
				destruction). </p>
			<p>Of the fate of this band of resistors, <a id="onmarch">only one record survives</a>: {<a
					href="onmarch.html">on march</a>}, a fragment describing its early exploits in a campaign that, if
				it ever got fully underway, has not been documented elsewhere, and what became of them is unknown.</p>
