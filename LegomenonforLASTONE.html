			<p>The Writings of the self-described Last One are naturally of the first importance, and not only because
				they are among the oldest primary texts in the Archives: <a
					href="NewEcclesiastes.html#whateverhitus"><strong>whatever the catastrophe</strong></a> that brought
				the world of the Ancients to an end, their Author's liminal status &mdash; as one of the few who
				survived it &mdash; makes him the Father of the Archives, whose seed-texts comprised not only his
				personal jottings but also Writings from Before that were in his possession at the time. </p>
			<p>The Writings of this Author fall into two categories: memoiric accounts of life in the immediate
				aftermath of <a id="thelastbutoneoftheAncients">the cataclysm that made him</a> <a
					href="thelastbutoneoftheAncients.html#note">the last but one of the Ancients</a>, and the theoretic
				discourse of a trenchant thinker struggling to comprehend from his lonely perspective what caused his
				race to self-immolate. </p>
			<p>The earliest of this prolific Author's Writings is <a id="LastOneandBoy">the apparent diary entry here
					called</a> {<a href="LastOneandBoy.html">Last One and Boy</a>}, which is rather a composite of
				fragments than a consistent narrative, likely written very soon after the events it describes: the
				adoption of a lost young boy in the immediate aftermath of what the Last One calls 'whatever hit us'.
			</p>
			<p><a id="morningsofcreation">The lyrical</a> {<a href="morningsofcreation.html">mornings of creation</a>}
				presents an almost idyllic picture of the Last One's companionship with the otherwise unnamed Boy he
				into his care; it is instructive to compare this with the Boy's own memoir in {<a
					href="return.html"><strong>return</strong></a>}. </p>
			<p><a id="Theyrecomingapart">The somewhat later Writing</a> {<a href="Theyrecomingapart.html">they're coming
					apart...</a>} strikes a rather elegiac tone, in which the Author recalls the dear ones of his former
				life. </p>
			<p><a id="whattoleavebehind">And finally among his autobiographic Writings</a>, in {<a
					href="whattoleavebehind.html">what to leave behind</a>} the Last One considers what the Boy will
				need after he is left alone... </p>
			<p>As mentioned, it was almost certainly the Last One whose holdings constituted the anthology of texts
				Egderus later used to form the Archives bearing his name. In addition to his fragmentary memoirs, the
				Last One brought to bear his considerable intellect in Writings that, taken together, contain what might
				be called the distillation of his thought. </p>
			<p><a id="impatience">In a kind of prolegomenon</a>, the gnomic {<a href="impatience.html">impatience</a>},
				the Last One opens his discursus by indirectly proposing that the lack (or failure) of forbearance may
				be his besetting sin, by declaring what brings in his nemeses, the ghosts. </p>
			<p><a id="theghosts">His foundational document, as it were</a>, is {<a href="theghosts.html">the
					ghosts</a>}, which has drawn particular attention (much of it needlessly unkind, it must be said) on
				account of its unusual theme, leading some to ascribe this peculiar text not to an Ancient author, but
				to the much more recent creator (or creators) of the <a
					href="LegomenonforROMANTICIMPULSEWRITINGS.html"><strong>Romantic Impulse Writings</strong></a>
				&mdash; indeed, its peculiarity has prompted more than one accusation that the whole lobe of Writings
				attributed to the Last One is a fabrication &mdash; or, to be more generous, the invention of (a)
				fabulist(s).</p>
			<p>Need it be said? &mdash; <em>all</em> of the Writings in the Archives are susceptible to that kind of
				nihilistic joykilling, which serves no other purpose than to poison the well for everyone else. </p>
			<p><a id="ThePerpetratedWorld">The diatribe</a> {<a href="ThePerpetratedWorld.html">The Perpetrated
					World</a>} sets forth the principle upon which the entire discourse rests: that the whole world we
				live in is a ghostly fabrication, an illusion made entirely out of text. </p>
			<p><a id="Everyartifactisatransmission">Three corollaries follow</a>: {<a
					href="Everyartifactisatransmission.html">Every artifact is a transmission</a>} notes not only the
				profusion of text into the very objects that make up our daily lives, <a id="sailaway">but also its
					delusory nature</a>; {<a href="sailaway.html">sail away</a>} describes <a id="transport">the
					intoxicating sweep of this kind of life</a>; and {<a href="transport.html">transport</a>} proposes
				the further principle that text is the very dwelling place of the ghosts.</p>
			<p>A last pronouncement bookends the more or less formal discussion that <a id="impatience">begins with the
					invocatory</a> {<a href="impatience.html"><strong>impatience</strong></a>}: <a id="enemy">in the
					acerbic</a> {<a href="enemy.html">enemy</a>}, the Last One reformulates his oft-expressed hostility
				towards text itself. (An earlier Curator perceived in these two offerings technical matters that
				prompted lengthy comment; this material <a id="Onimpatienceandtheenemy">has been removed to a separate
					Scholion</a> {<a href="Onimpatienceandtheenemy.html#note">On impatience and the enemy</a>}.)</p>
			<p>Given the Last One's antagonism towards text, the answer to <a id="anotherlifeform">the bitter riddle
					posed</a> in {<a href="anotherlifeform.html">another life form</a>} cannot be hard to guess.</p>
			<p><a id="mirror">The peculiar thought experiment</a> {<a href="mirror.html">mirror</a>} implies that it may
				have been this invention which ultimately led to the fatal calamity that destroyed the world of his
				contemporaries. <a id="LastOneflying">More broadly</a>, in {<a href="LastOneflying.html">Last One
					flying</a>}, he seems to indict technology itself for their (and his) ruin. </p>
			<p>However that may be, in <a id="deities">the almost scriptural language</a> of {<a
					href="deities.html">deities</a>}, the Last One demonstrates a lyrical gift, outlining his spiritual
				journey from youthful faith through disillusionment to the peace he may have attained at his end, when
				the vaporous compulsions of the world dissolve like mist in the sun, landing him on the shore of silence
				and serenity at last.</p>
