			<p>These often whimsical Writings constitute what may have been intended as a collection of exemplary tales
				or fables about the personal lives of historical or semi-historical figures. It has been proposed with
				some success that these Writings were intended for young persons, perhaps even children.</p>
			<p>The familiar appellation <a id="tenderheart">'Romantic Impulse' Writings</a> derives from <a
					href="LegomenonforOTHERWRITINGSofUNKNOWNPROVENANCE.html#tenderheart">the imputed tender heart</a> of
				their unidentified Author, who treats their protagonists with affection as well as respect, apparently
				in an effort to 'bring them to life' for readers, though this perception of their Author may itself be
				of Romantic (or even Sentimental) Impulse. </p>
			<p><a id="YoungRobenc">The fragment</a> (<a href="YoungRobenc.html">Young Robenc</a>} presents a charming
				portrait of two of Egderus' associates, Robenc and the Superius Frater, the latter being Egderus' mentor
				in his earliest days at Mountain House. It is unclear whether the concluding section of this Writing was
				lost, or if this is an incomplete draft its Author never did finish. <a id="Robencreturns">The even more
					disjunct</a> {<a href="Robencreturns.html">Robenc Returns</a>} presents a mere sketch of what may be
				the prologue to that moment in his life described in the much earlier Writing {<a
					href="SuperiusFraterandRobenc.html"><strong>Superius Frater and Robenc</strong></a>}, ostensibly
				composed by the Frater himself. The mirroristical quality of all three Writings &mdash; they all seem to
				be versions a meeting between Robenc and the Superius Frater, though at different times in the
				participants' lives, has caused some to surmise that all are a hoax by the same hand. This seems
				absurdly cynical &mdash; why would anybody do that? </p>
			<p><a id="TheExquisiteSuzu">Apparently an unfinished sketch</a>, {<a href="TheExquisiteSuzu.html">The
					Exquisite Suzu</a>} is unique, in that its heroine's name appears nowhere else in the archives.
				Although some have identified Suzu with the Author known as the <a
					href="LegomenonforVOICEfromtheLOCUSTGROVE.html"><strong>Voice from the Locust Grove</strong></a>,
				the evidence for this ascription is disputed.</p>
			<p><a id="TheStarling">It is commonly believed</a> that {<a href="TheStarling.html">The Starling</a>} may
				portray the 'nurse' described in the somewhat problematic {<a
					href="HistoriansNotebook.html"><strong>Historian's Notebook</strong></a>} &mdash; the young female
				who took care of him at the beginning of <a id="tookrefuge">his sojourn with the Remnant (<a
						href="LegomenonforHISTORIAN.html#tookrefuge">if his rescuers can be so identified</a>).</p>
			<p><a id="MarkitoScriptor">The very brief Writing</a> {<a href="MarkitoScriptor.html">Markito Scriptor</a>}
				was apparently intended to tell how Markito came to be, as some propose, the first Curator of the
				archives in historical times; he may in fact have done no more than help his master <a
					href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus</strong></a> collect and organize the artifacts that
				were long afterwards discovered by the <a href="LegomenonforSCHOLAR.html"><strong>Scholar</strong></a>.
				<a id="MarkitoCurator">It has been plausibly argued, however</a>, that <a
					href="LegomenonforTheMISSIONARY.html#MarkitoCurator">Markito may have been responsible for far more
					than this</a>... </p>
			<p><a id="Starlingredux">Finally</a>, {<a href="Starlingredux.html">Starling redux</a>} &mdash; <a
					id="redux">meaning perhaps 'returning to the Starling's story'</a>; compare {<a
					href="LegomenonforSCHOLAR.html#redux">Scholar's Apology, redux</a>} &mdash; presents a sequel to her
				portrayal in the original Writing that bears her name, unless her story was taken up later by a
				different Author. No other explanation has been put forth for this apparent anomaly. </p>
