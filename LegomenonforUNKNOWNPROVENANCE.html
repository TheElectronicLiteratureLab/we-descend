			<p>These Writings have proved undatable, even employing the most sophisticated forensic practice, but the
				consensus of opinion is that they were composed more recently than the work of all other Authors
				identified in the Archives.</p>
			<p>Under the first heading are Writings attributed to the mysterious <a
					href="LegomenonfortheRemnant.html"><strong>Remnant</strong></a>, an unidentifiable group of sages or
				seers whose pronouncements on the nature of existence appear throughout the Archives. The Writings of
				the so-called <a href="LegomenonforROMANTICIMPULSEWRITINGS.html"><strong>Romantic Impluse
						Author</strong></a> are the only ones in this timeBand that can plausibly be attributed to a
				single person; those clustered under the heading <a
					href="LegomenonforINSOMNIAC.html"><strong>Insomniac</strong></a> are understood to have been brought
				together by a previous Curator with a strong opinion as to their authorship, but no hard proof (if such
				a thing could possibly exist) has survived their transmission. The <a
					href="LegomenonforOTHERWRITINGSofUNKNOWNPROVENANCE.html"><strong>Other Writings of Unknown
						Provenance</strong></a> gathered here are truly the miscellaneous remnant of the rest, which
				cannot with confidence be placed elsewhere in time.</p>
			<p>Naturally such uncertainty has proved frustrating for many, but this lacuna in our knowledge of where,
				when, and how these voices from the past have reached us should not interfere with our engagement with
				the stories they tell, however disjointedly. After all, is this not the situation we bear with ease when
				meeting &mdash; and gradually coming to know &mdash; every other person who shares with us the world we
				inhabit day to day?</p>
