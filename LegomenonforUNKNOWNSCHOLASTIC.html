			<p><a id="conspiracy">The lengthy narrative</a> {<a href="conspiracy.html">conspiracy</a>} has proved
				invaluable in providing a detailed description of life in the Temple School during the last moments of
				its normal life. It also portrays <a id="wedescend">the immediate, pragmatic impact of the so-called</a>
				<a href="LegomenonforSCHOLAR.html#wedescend">'We Descend' heresy</a> (ie that the Ancients were not
				deities, but ordinary mortals like ourselves) on the political life of the Conference to whom the
				Scholar presented his discovery of the Archives, as well as some elements of their post-Temple
				transmission to us. </p>
			<p>In addition, it tentatively links its narrator to the Author known as <a
					href="LegomenonforVOICEfromtheLOCUSTGROVE.html"><strong>Locust Grove Author</strong></a>, and from
				this connection has encouraged some to propose at least one 'resting place' for the Archives after they
				were rescued from the destruction of the Temple: up in the head of a huge bell where presumably this
				Author secreted them for preservation until their rescue &mdash; by his unknown successor, whom he could
				only imagine and wish for, but never know.</p>
