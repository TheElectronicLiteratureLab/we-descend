			<p><a id="MoreWritings">More writings have come into my possession</a>. <a id="forgery">I can only describe
					them as astounding</a>, enough so that <a href="ScholarsDiary.html#forgery">my original suspicion of
					forgery</a> has been reawakened.</p>
			<p>In the first place, some of them explain &mdash; rather too conveniently, I feel &mdash; gaps in the
				story as I had originally reconstructed it, almost as if the characters, hearing that they were being
				unfairly or incompletely represented to (or by) me, had come forward to speak for themselves.</p>
			<p>In particular, <a id="overinsistent">Egderus, in these additional writings, begins to impress me</a> as
				<a href="overinsistent.html#note">overinsistent</a> on his own righteousness, <a id="escape">at least in
					regard to</a> <a href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html#escape">his collusion in the escape of the
					Historian</a>.</p>
			<p>But most intriguing is the so-called Historian's portrait of his rescuers, whose identity remains a
				mystery. <a id="Threepossibilities">I can think of only</a> <a href="Threepossibilities.html#note">three
					possibilities</a> to account for them: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>They were an aboriginal people.</li>
				<li> were the direct descendants of the Ancients.</li>
				<li> are a figment of someone's imagination.</li>
			</ol>
			&nbsp;
			<p>&Dagger; <u>An Aboriginal People</u></p>
			<p>This interpretation is in some ways the most attractive because the least controversial. In recent
				explorations of the frontier, several groups of previously unknown peoples have been encountered, and
				often their cultures differed significantly from our own. True, their language and many of their customs
				have subsequently been found to relate to ours, suggesting that originally our two peoples were a single
				clan that somehow became separated over the generations. But it is not impossible to conceive of an
				unknown race or even species inhabiting the much more extensive wilderness of Egderus' time, whose only
				contacts with his world, prior to their extinction, had been infrequent and fleeting.</p>
			<p>Should this be the case, we would need to recast Egderus' statements of fact as instead being
				suppositions, perhaps fanciful conjectures, that were based on the beliefs of his times, about which I
				must reassert we know very little.</p>
			<p>&Dagger;&Dagger; <u>Descendants of the Ancients</u></p>
			<p>This is the interpretation that the Archives, taken as a whole, tend to support. If the Archives are
				genuine, it is a hard task to dismiss this reading of the evidence. </p>
			<p> As I indicated, the conclusions proceeding from this interpretation are troubling. It means nothing less
				than that the Ancients, far from being divinities, as we have been assuming was the belief in Egderus'
				time &mdash; a widespread conviction even up to the present day &mdash; but rather creatures at the very
				best no different from ourselves in our bodily nature. According to this hypothesis, some monstrous
				catastrophe befell their civilization (or was brought on by themselves), and the Remnant &mdash; at
				least as outlined in the more or less reliable sources (that is, discounting the almost certainly
				spurious '<a href="HistoriansNotebook.html"><strong>Historian's Notebook</strong></a>') &mdash; perforce
				went 'back to nature', under the harshest imaginable conditions, and for generations &mdash; that is, a
				period of time sufficient to completely efface all but the vaguest memory of the glory of that
				civilization.</p>
			<p>It also means that the Ancients actually did exist.</p>
			<p>&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger; <u>A Figment of Someone's Imagination </u></p>
			<p>In another way, this is the most tempting interpretation, especially for anyone of a skeptical nature. In
				fact, I shouldn't be surprised if some of my more dubious auditors conclude that the entire Archive is
				of my own composition!</p>
			<p>Of course that is not true, but it is possible that someone else has composed some, or most, or even all
				of these documents with the idea of perpetrating a hoax on our scholarly world, selecting me as chief
				dupe. Should that prove to be the case, I shall be utterly ruined, first of all for my own gullibility,
				and secondly for being the instrument &mdash; insofar as I persuade anyone to believe me &mdash; by
				which my entire community is exposed to ridicule.</p>
			&nbsp;
			<p>Naturally I find this last interpretation the least congenial of the three. First, my vanity prohibits me
				from conceiving myself as being so credulous: despite my lack of significant acclaim, I have made a
				solid contribution to the increase of knowledge, and my apprenticeship was completed long ago. Although
				it is theoretically possible for me to be fooled, it cannot be done so easily.</p>
			<p>Second, who would do such a thing? And why? And why choose me, of all people, to be cat's paw?</p>
			<p>And finally, I am <em>persuaded</em> by these voices (or some of them!) from long ago. To be honest, I
				know of no way to actually prove the authenticity of all or any of these writings, and the only way to
				disprove their authenticity is to produce the hoaxer(s) who composed them, an unlikely prospect at best.
			</p>
			<p>No: I have spent the emotional and spiritual equivalent of years of my life with these people, and I
				believe in them &mdash; whether they existed or not, I am surprised to say. And <a id="thosewhofollow">I
					am also convinced</a> that <a href="ScholarsFarewell.html#thosewhofollow">others who follow will
					find themselves persuaded by these stories</a>, if I can somehow present them fairly.</p>
