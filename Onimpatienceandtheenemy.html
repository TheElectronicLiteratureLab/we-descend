			<p>[Editorial note: the following technical discussions were provided by a former Curator with a special
				interest in the discourse of the <a href="LegomenonforLASTONE.html"><strong>Last One</strong></a>.]</p>
			<p>On {<a href="impatience.html"><strong>impatience</strong></a>}:</p>
			<blockquote>Impatience blows the trumpet<br>
				for the Advent of the ghosts.</blockquote>
			<p><a id="alongerallegoricalwork">The earliest interpretation of this cryptic saying, that it is a
					fragment</a> from <a href="alongerallegoricalwork.html">a longer allegorical work</a> &mdash; a
				pageant or historical enactment, perhaps set to music &mdash; is almost certainly wrong. No context for
				such a performance can be derived from any Writing in the Archives, not to mention the torsion required
				to credit this construal's absurd claim: that 'the ghosts' were some kind of lesser deities &mdash; even
				mortals raised to godly rank after death! &mdash; who served as messengers between the divine Ancients
				and the human world. </p>
			<p>Such an imaginative explanation likely arose before any other Writings of the Last One were discovered or
				attributed. (Among the Authors in the Archives, the Last One is the earliest to mention 'the ghosts'.)
				<a href="theghosts.html"><strong>However, the entities he calls 'the ghosts'</strong></a> in his
				extended discourse easily resist such simplistic analysis; in his philosophy of life, they stand in the
				first rank of importance. His manifold vituperations against the ghosts portray a formidable race of
				enchanters whom <a href="ThePerpetratedWorld.html#self-immolation"><strong>he blames entirely for the
						cataclysm</strong></a> that destroyed his world, the magnificent civilization of the Ancients.
			</p>
			<p>There does exist (or did: the original has never been located) what may have been an early 'draft' of
				this saying, never officially incorporated into any previous structuring of the Archives, <a
					id="amongthemiscellaneaofunplaceableartifacts">but ever lurking, as it were</a>, <a
					href="amongthemiscellaneaofunplaceableartifacts.html">among the miscellanea of unplaceable
					artifacts</a> when they were transmitted. Here is a reconstruction of that text:</p>
			<blockquote><strike>The yelp of impatience trumpets<br>
					the Advent of the ghosts.</strike></blockquote>
			<p>[By all reports, strikethrough in original. &mdash; Ed.]</p>
			<p>This variant of the saying, though similar in sense, bears different freight, to wit: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> in the &laquo;draft version&raquo; quoted just above, the 'yelp of impatience' merely
					<em>announces</em> that the ghosts are near, or on their way, thus describing a symptom beyond the
					observer's control; whereas </li>
				<li>in the &laquo;received version&raquo; reproduced in this edition, the act of becoming impatient
					itself has agency (it blows a trumpet), which summons the ghosts into the scene, whereupon,
					presumably, they bring to bear their ruinous influence on whatever ensues.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In either case, one must wonder: how can it be that impatience serves to reveal or, worse, musters the
				ghosts? </p>
			<p>Let us pause for a moment to ponder the operant term &laquo;impatience&raquo;, which serves as the title
				of this antique Writing: it will more than repay any interruption in the flow of thought thus far. </p>
			<p>What is impatience, after all? The loss (or relinquishment) of equanimity, in reaction to <a
					id="unexpected">an unanticipated development in the unfolding of time</a>: <a
					href="whichisatfault.html#unexpected">one had expected (or wished) one thing</a> was to occur, but
				something else happened instead. </p>
			<p>Interrogating this circumstance, we must back away enough to perceive two elements that constitute the
				situation, an expectation and the event, and then ask, How did this expectation or wish come about? or,
				to hint at an answer by rephrasing the question, What was the origin of the unsound expectation in the
				first place? </p>
			<p><a id="WhoamI">How would the Last One reply? How else?</a> &mdash; The ghosts, <a
					href="WhoamI.html">fool</a>. What did you think? </p>
			&nbsp;
			<p>On {<a href="enemy.html"><strong>enemy</strong></a>}: </p>
			<blockquote>Text is our enemy: the utterance of the ghosts.</blockquote>
			<p>This brief indictment was originally thought to be a paragraph taken from {<a
					href="Whatcanwedohere.html"><strong>What can we do here?</strong></a>}, itself a much-copied
				transcription that <a id="SermonsofEgderus">by custom was bundled with the so-called</a> <a
					href="SermonsofEgderus.html#note">Sermons of Egderus</a>, presumably delivered during <a
					href="MarkitoScriptor.html"><strong>his tenure as Superius Frater at Mountain House</strong></a>. A
				later curator extracted this specific passage from that Writing to its own document, certain that its
				first sentence (or two, depending on how it is parsed) <a id="migratorytext">represented an instance
					of</a> <a href="asthepoemsays.html#migratorytext">migratory text</a>, claiming that it was in fact a
				bona fide Saying of the Remnant (without specifying how that attribution was to be validated), and that
				the brief explicatory phrase (about immortal fame) which followed constituted a gloss that itself became
				separated from its original referent and was re-attached here.</p>
			<p>The thesis that motivated this act of violence upon an ancient arrangement of the Archives has
				ramifications that can be treacherous, but are worth outlining here, as no one else seems to have
				perceived the need for this essential forensic work.</p>
			<p><a id="inthesecondclause">To begin with, the mention of the ghosts</a> <a
					href="inthesecondclause.html#note">in the second clause</a> at least implicates the <a
					href="LegomenonforLASTONE.html"><strong>Last One</strong></a>, whose Writings constitute an entire
				discourse on the entities (or, perhaps better expressed, collective symbol) he calls the ghosts: his
				assertion in those Writings is that their origin, medium of action, and <a
					href="thedwellingplaceoftheghosts.html"><strong>dwelling place</strong></a> are all founded in
				&mdash; even wholly constituted by &mdash; text. </p>
			<p>Although <a href="LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus</strong></a> never mentions the ghosts
				anywhere else in his extant writings, he is all but universally believed to have passed along the works
				of the Last One when he gathered, preserved, and transmitted the Archives during the Goliadic Age. This
				being the case, it is hard to believe that Egderus was not familiar with the Last One's theories, and
				may well have become 'infected' with one or another of that elder Author's crabby ideas.</p>
			<p>But this is mere background. It is when we try to analyze the transmission of this tart morsel of
				invective that the true dimensions of the matter begin to emerge.</p>
			<p>Let us begin with the obvious, as contemporary investigators are ever advocating. This string of text
				(migratory or not) was found among the Writings of Egderus, and so may well be a writing <em>by</em>
				Egderus. If so, is it complete, in its present form, that is, by itself? Perhaps, but this seems
				unlikely: Egderus is frequently aphoristic, but almost always attributes his pithy sayings to the <a
					href="LegomenonfortheRemnant.html"><strong>Remnant</strong></a>, and even then only to illustrate or
				support one point among many in a longer essay, sermon, or memoir &mdash; that is, Egderus never seems
				to have composed epigrams that stand on their own. </p>
			<p>But Egderus is hardly unique in quoting the Remnant, nor in employing crisp locutions of his own
				invention. Let us allow, then, that this particular example is a fragment of some other Writing &mdash;
				whether by Egderus or not may be argued elsewhere. </p>
			<p>The question is, what motivated its extraction from the document in which it was found? </p>
			<p>[The text of this peculiar (and peculiarly long) consideration breaks off here &mdash; Ed.]</p>
