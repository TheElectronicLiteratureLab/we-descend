				On the Arrangement of the Writings
			</h3>
		</header>
				
		<section class="inscription">
			<p>In the course of transmitting this Archive of archives, its Curators have found it useful to divide the over three hundred Writings it comprises into three textTypes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u>primary texts</u>, the personal narratives forming the fundamental materials of the Archives;</li>
				<li><u>secondary texts</u>, commentaries that annotate and elucidate the primary texts; and</li>
				<li><u>tertiary texts</u>, which a framework for the whole: lists, outlines, maps(!) and other affordances for finding a way in, through, and around the Writings</li>
			</ul>
			<p><u>Primary Writings</u> have been arranged throughout <a href="indescendingorder.html#note">in descending order</a> by Author, within a an overarching structure of historical eras called <a href="timeBands.html"><strong>timeBands</strong></a>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the most recent timeBand is designated as being of <a href="UNKNOWNPROVENANCE.html"><strong>Unknown Provenance</strong></a>, since nothing is known of the transmission of the Archives since</li>
				<li>the <a href="AGEoftheSCHOLAR.html"><strong>Age of the Scholar</strong></a>, a figure associated with the community of the Temple of Learning during its flourishing, and who rediscovered the Archives at some point after</li>
				<li>the <a href="AGEofEGDERUS.html"><strong>Age of Egderus</strong></a>, their first Curator, who, in addition to providing a vivid portrait of his own life and times, first gathered in one place</li>
				<li>the Writings of <a href="TheANCIENTS.html"><strong>The Ancients</strong></a>, denizens of a magnificent civilization that they themselves destroyed.</li> 
			</ul>
			</p>This arrangement somewhat resembles the cross-section of an archaeological excavation &mdash; more recent items appear near the top, older ones lie towards the bottom. (Within each Author's listing, however, the titles appear in their (deduced) order of composition. Consult scholion {<a href="indescendingorder.html"><strong>in descending order</strong></a>} for a discussion of this controversial gambit.)</p>
			<p><u>Secondary Writings</u> are of two kinds,  <a href="LEGOMENA.html"><strong>Legomona</strong></a> and<a href="SCHOLIA.html"><strong>Scholia</strong></a>. Each Legomenon elucidates all the Writings of a given Author or group; each Scholion annotates a particula4 passage within a specific Writing. The long catalogs that list the Legomena and the Scholia are, as with the primaryTexts, ranked in descending order of their referents.</p>
			<p><u>Tertiary Writings</u> appear as needed throughout the Archives &mdash; for example, in the catalogs known as bookPlates (such as the bookPlate <a href="EGDERUS.html"><strong>Egderus</strong></a>)
			as ancillary Writings such as the <a href="PrefacetotheCompleteEdition.html"><strong>Preface</strong></a>, the <a href="ForewordtotheArchives.html"><strong>Foreword</strong></a>, and the <a href="AfterwordTransmissionoftheArchives.html"><strong>Afterword</strong></a>, act as general guides to help the reader understand how the Writings are related to one another and to get around among them.</p>
