			<p>I dare not entrust this writing even to my utterly faithful scriptor, for if he even knows about it, it will be a great danger to him. Before I was made Praetor, there was one order laid upon me that only three people knew about: <a id="firstmaster">the Golias, who gave the order; I, who carried it out</a>; and <a href="MPart2.html#firstmaster">your first master, the 8th Superius Frater</a> at Mountain House, upon whom the order was performed. I am not sure why the Golias wanted it done, but I am certain that the reason he wanted me to do it was to keep it secret. Perhaps you know why; I can only tell you that I made it quick, if not painless.</p>
			<p>The moment he saw me, he knew why I was there. In the event, he seemed to welcome it, and assured me that he bore me no ill will. He also asked about you, but I told him I knew nothing. I don't know if that is what you would have wanted, but there was no time nor way to ask.</p>
