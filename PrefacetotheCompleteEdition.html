			<p>[<cite>TECHNICAL NOTE: Longer Writings, like this Preface, which might extend beyond one screenful of text, <a id="movingthetextitself">will appear in multiple columns, as in an ancient scroll</a>, and may be read by <a href="movingthetextitself.html#note">moving the text itself</a> left or right. However, for the sake of readability, lists and other apparati are displayed in a single column that can be shifted up and down.</cite>]</p>
			<p><cite>We Descend</cite> is the title given by present curator Bill Bly to his hypertext rendering of the Archives Pertaining to Egderus Scriptor, writings gathered and transmitted (by Egderus and others) over a span of many generations. Here collected in one edition will be found all the texts previously issued in three separate volumes.</p> 
			<p>Volume One of <cite>We Descend</cite> was published EV 1997 as a standalone computer application distributed by <a href="https://www.eastgate.com/catalog/WeDescend.html" target="_blank">Eastgate Systems</a>; Volume Two was brought out in the online journal <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/journals/newriver/17Fall/index.html" target="_blank"><cite>The New River</cite>, Fall 2017</a>. In addition, a 'preliminary view' of Volume Three appeared in <a href="http://thenewriver.us/we-descend" target="_blank"><cite>The New River</cite>, Fall 2019</a>. The edition you are reading now presents Volume Three in full, and <a id="heretoforeunpublished">includes a number of Writings</a> <a href="heretoforeunpublished.html#note">heretofore unpublished</a>.</p>
			<p>Over the course of this project, the process of preparing the Writings has matured, with the inevitable consequence that some inconsistencies appeared not only in the narratives of certain Authors, but also in the apparatus in which they were housed. This omnibus edition attempts to smooth out that unevenness, though some irregularities were felt to be part of their story, and were retained.</p>
			<!--<p>In any archive of writings, many voices speak, and it can take some time to discern how they are related to one another. In the present case, two entrances have been contrived, one for persons reading <cite>We Descend</cite> for the first time, and the other for return visitors. If this is your first time, the simplest way to embark on a journey into the Archives is to follow the PATHWAY, a kind of introductory tour, which departs from the word 'Begin' on the <a href="1TITLE.html">TITLE</a> page; this procedure will take you through fifteen Writings of varying length. The PATHWAY</a> will introduce you to most of the persons of <cite>We Descend</cite> and some of their stories. At the PATHWAY's end, you will arrive at an interstitial directory called the <a href="LANDING.html"><strong>LANDING</strong></a>, which will act as a portal to Writings you have not yet seen, and afford other apparati that will be useful in exploring the Archives further.</p>
			<p>At the bottom of each text field, there will appear a strip of text links leading BACKWARD and FORWARD, with a link in between them to PATHWAY, a list of all the Writings you will encounter along your way.</p>-->
			
			<p><strong>About links in this edition</strong></p>

			<p>In contrast to items in a linkList or the navigationLinks at the bottom of every page, links in the body of a Writing generally work on a semantic basis &mdash; that is, a differently colored word or phrase links to a separate Writing, as you might expect; when you arrive, a phrase will appear highlighted for a moment to help you find your place. Nearby will be a related phrase with a colored link to help you return from whence you came.</p>
			<p>However, where you encounter a link in <a href="boldfacetype.html">boldface type</a>, that link works <em>one-way only</em>; to return from wherever it leads, you will need to use the directional control on your reading device.</p>
