			<p><a id="bogle">The name of</a> <a href="TheRetreatHouse.html#bogle">a bogle who appeared in certain early folk tales</a> deriving from this period. At times he was a terrifying figure, reputed to devour little children who misbehaved &mdash; or, oddly, to "snatch them through the ceiling" &mdash; particularly those who had entered forbidden precincts.</p>
			<p>In some tales, however, the Raggedy Man proved to be a savior in great danger, a secret ally who knew hidden paths, or who possessed magical artifacts that could either kill his enemies or rescue those under his (often ill-appreciated) protection.</p>
			<p>In at least one instance, <a href="ManintheMoon.html">the Raggedy Man is identified with the Man in the Moon</a>.</p>
