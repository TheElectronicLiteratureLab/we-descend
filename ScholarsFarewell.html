			<p>I wish there were more time. I feel I have only just begun the actual work, and suddenly I must give over
				to another, to you, whose care of the Archives <a id="curacy">will naturally be dictated by your own
					preoccupations</a>. <a href="ScholarsVision.html#curacy">My curacy is over now</a>.</p>
			<p>I have decided not to withhold anything, but instead to offer up the entire story, and let you decide how
				to proceed. Since I am to have no say in what is done with (or to) the Archives, nor any access to them
				after the handing-over, I have resolved not to serve badly my precious charge, in these last days, by
				making it difficult for my supplanter to come to the same appreciation of its worth.</p>
			<p>This may be made difficult for you by others. As the Remnant say, Beware the giver with nothing to gain.
			</p>
			<p>I urge you not to depend upon the benignity of your sponsors. Not to give offense, but the Council
				members surely regard this as minor research, or it would not have been entrusted to you: had your
				betters regarded this project as really important you may be sure they would have seized upon it
				themselves.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, they clearly believed the Archives important enough to take them away from me. What
				they most likely told you was that this would be a good project for their golden prot&eacute;g&eacute;,
				thus trivializing not only all my labor but the Archives themselves.</p>
			<p>Well. I put myself under their power, so I must not complain of maltreatment. But I will never forgive
				their light regard for the object of my life's work. And if you are wise, you will realize that you too
				have been trivialized in this maneuver.</p>
			<p>But neither their rhetoric nor their machinations can diminish the true value of the Archives in the
				slightest.</p>
			<p>Therefore, I exhort you not to broadcast too soon the excitement you will certainly feel once you have
				penetrated to the heart of the Archives. As you will see, this was my first mistake, if not my last.
				However, it was safer for me to err so than it will be for you, because the reaction against my
				enthusiasm has <a id="thosewhofollow">as it were poisoned the well</a> <a
					href="MoreWritings.html#thosewhofollow">for those who follow</a>.</p>
			<p>I have every confidence that you have been told I am an eccentric &mdash; and worse, perhaps: a fool.
				That's as may be; I only ask that you come to that conclusion on your own, on the basis of the work I
				have done, not on the superficial pronouncements of self-important persons who have no idea of the value
				of this treasure. Think of what is most important to them: reputation among others like themselves. Then
				read the Archives.</p>
			<p>I once believed that bringing forth these writings from the remote past would make my reputation, <a
					id="augustpersons">gain me equal status</a> amongst <a
					href="TheLocustGrove.html#augustpersons">those august personages</a>. You see what happened. Now
				consult your own heart. If you are likewise motivated, beware. An older man than yourself would perhaps
				not need this warning, having suffered a blow or two to his pride and found that the damage could be
				outlived.</p>
			<p>However, what is truly important here is neither your maturity (or lack of it) nor my pride. What matters
				is the integrity of the Archives, which will soon make a claim upon your loyalty, or so I hope, that
				will transcend these pathetic preoccupations.</p>
			<p>Now to the matter at hand. Included herein, in addition to the Archives themselves, are all my notes,
				abstracts, conjectures, drafts, and diagrams. I apologize for their disarray, but I was given only
				enough time to put the Archives themselves into some kind of arrangement.</p>
			<p>No doubt you will find this arrangement unsatisfactory, and will wish to assemble the writings according
				to your own sense of their proper presentation. I cannot stop you, but would plead that I had good
				reason for putting things in the order I did, even if I was not allowed leisure to write out in detail
				the rationale for that order.</p>
			<p>At some later date, <a id="anyfinalthoughts">when I have had time to regain my composure</a>, I will send
				you <a href="anyfinalthoughts.html#note">any final thoughts</a> I may have on the Archives, either
				advice based on my experience with them, or further meditations upon their significance. You will of
				course be entirely free to ignore these messages &mdash; if they are permitted to reach you at all.</p>
			<p>But please know that I hereby freely renounce any right I may have imagined I had to control their
				destiny. Having made their way through many generations to me and now to you, their capacity to survive
				can hardly be in doubt.</p>
