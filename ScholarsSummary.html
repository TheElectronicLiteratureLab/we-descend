			<p>History... myth... the remnant, preserved for a later generation, <a id="albatross">not as an exemplar</a>, but an <a href="albatross.html#note">albatross</a>.</p>
			<p>The world was all but destroyed. For generations, nothing but merest survival. Except, among the remnant, stories.</p>
			<p>Time rose like smoke away from the flames, in a line that bent this way and that, but ever ascended. Away, above.</p>
			<p>When light dawned again, the world belonged, as always, to Golias, the man of strength, numbers, technology.</p>
			<p><a id="drivenintothewilderness">The remnant were identified, herded together</a>, <a href="drivenintothewilderness.html#note">driven into the wilderness</a>. </p>
			<p>The world became what Golias said it was. The remnant were forgotten. There were no stories, no past, no history. Only now.</p>
			<p>The remnant perished, but their stories survived, passed from one exiled, sickly generation to the next. </p>
