			<p><u>My new Prior</u>, who likes to be called The Good Doctor:</p>
			<p>Arrogant, officious, bossy &mdash; just the type the Chief Examiner would send to keep an eye on me and
				my lambs. My only hope is that I can penetrate that prickly armor to the man beneath. If I cannot, there
				will be trouble...</p>
			<p><u>Phylax Gig</u>:</p>
			<p>Huge, choleric, ugly, a drunkard who chases the younger brothers with his axe when he is off duty &mdash;
				he used to be merely disgusting, but lately he seems to be losing control. He has stopped speaking, so
				say the stratioti, and only grunts and roars. I think he has seen something, or has seen the same thing
				too many times...</p>
			<p><u>Brother Egderus</u>:</p>
			<p>My sweet son, now nearly a man. I wish I really could be his father, but I cannot protect him. I cannot
				protect myself. But perhaps his affliction can be a shield as well as a handicap. I have noticed that
				the fools who taunt him, including the so-called Good Doctor, seem to think he is stupid as well as
				lame. He himself seems wise enough not to contradict them...</p>
			<p><u>The new Phylax Robenc</u>:</p>
			<p>Fierce, proud, strong of mind &mdash; also young and impetuous enough to have tripped up somewhere, or he
				would not have been posted here. I would guess either he got into a fight with the wrong comrade, or
				else became 'impudent' with the wrong officer or bureaucrat, and this is his probationary posting...</p>
