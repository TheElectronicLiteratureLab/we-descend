			<p>This is the Land Where No Man Is.</p>
			<p><a id="stillness">There is peace here</a>. <a href="Rhapsody.html#stillness">Stillness, at last</a>.</p>
			<p>Relief. One feels safe, <a id="brandishing">if only for the moment: the chase, the flight</a>, <a
					href="intheKeep.html#brandishing">the incessant clashing or brandishing of weapons</a>, fighting
				one's way through the pack of others <a id="impatience">fighting their way, or else biding one's
					time</a> with <a href="onmarch.html#impatience">impatience</a>, reading the signs, tasting the wind,
				parsing the clouds &mdash; <a id="eachalone">all done with, as if long ago</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="fellowship.html#eachalone">Few come here</a>; fewer still return to the land where all men are.
				Once brought here, one understands why. In the land where all men are, it is nearly impossible to
				conceive <a id="findit">that there even is such a place as the land where no man is</a>, <a
					href="MPart2.html#findit">let alone find it</a>. Nearly. And nearly is near enough for most, for
				they have other things to do &mdash; for other men, to other men, with other men, in the world they have
				builded together.</p>
			<p>Of the very very few for whom the word 'impossible' is not a comfort but a summons, very very few ever
				find the land where no man is, for they do not know how to look for such a place: all their maps and
				their diagrams, <a id="theirlessonsandtheirpractices">their tools and their engines</a>, <a
					href="theirlessonsandtheirpractices.html#note">their lessons and their practices</a>, were devised
				to be deployed in the land where all men are, and none are any use in the land where no man is.</p>
			<p>There is no Teacher here, no Teaching to be brought back from here. <a id="wilderness">This is not</a> <a
					href="TheKindsofWildernesses.html#wilderness">the wilderness, in its many kinds</a>, of which the
				world is but one. To seek this place, one must set off in the opposite direction from all worlds.</p>
			<p>To approach the land where no man is, one must abandon every thing in the world, and this cannot be done
				without violence. It is also impossible to do without <a id="lonesurvivor">nearly impossible
					providence</a>, such as being <a href="TheRetreatHouse.html#lonesurvivor">the only survivor</a> of a
				holocaust of one's own igniting.</p>
