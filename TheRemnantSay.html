			To lose.<br>
			To suffer.<br>
			To learn.<br>
			These are the articles of faith.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&Dagger;&Dagger;</p>
			<p>The more you are hailed the victor &mdash; that much more humiliating will be your defeat.<br>
			From this you learn.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The more you are overborne by suffering &mdash; that much more suffering will pour down upon you.<br>
			From this you learn.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The more extensive your experience, the greater your mastery, the subtler your thinking, the more abundant your knowledge &mdash; that much the more naive, graceless, stupid, and ignorant you will be shown to be.<br>
			From this you learn.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;</p>
			<p>For victory means everything until it is achieved: the prize bestowed is no longer prized.<br>
			Winning means nothing:<br>
			A new challenge, a new test, must forever be proposed.<br>
			This is vanity.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;</p>
			<p>The loser suffers,<br>
			And gains through this suffering knowledge of the self, of the adversary, and of the contest.</p>
			<p>It is easy to see what was done wrong;<br>
			It is impossible to be certain of what was done right.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;</p>
			<p>To suffer is to be sure<br>
			Pain is clear</p>
