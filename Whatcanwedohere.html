			<p>I ask myself, <a id="provisionarefuge">What can we do here? we poor few? among so many? against so many?</a></p>
			<p>First we must <a href="threefoldmission.html#provisionarefuge">ready this place for as many as can come</a>.</p>
			<p>All the rooms must be put in order; all the passageways cleared; all the gear cleaned and kept in good repair; the windows washed, the floors swept, the beds made, the shelves put straight.</p>
			<p>Then we must prepare ourselves, day after day &mdash; for the task is immense, danger is near, and the time is short.</p>
			<p>We must sleep well, take exercise, breathe. We must make a moment each day to just be still.</p>
			<p>Above all, we must treat each other not only with respect and forbearance: we must be kind. None of us can do what must be done without the help of all others.</p>
			<p>Let us begin with these things.</p>
