			<p>Little children, you must never despair, never slacken in your efforts, never flag in zeal. Your cause is
				just. Your work is urgent.</p>
			<p>It does not matter that no one understands what you do. It does not matter if you do not always
				understand what you do. As the Remnant say, we will never know the deeper effects of our care.</p>
			<p>What you do is nothing less than saving our race. <a id="doesnotwishtobesaved">Even when it</a> <a
					id="doesnotwishtobesaved">does not know that it must be saved</a>, <a
					href="thiswork.html#doesnotwishtobesaved">even when it does not wish to be saved</a>, when its will
				is to go down into the dark and be lost forever to the ages, you must persevere.</p>
			<p>Encourage each other, take heart from your exertions, make them their own reward.</p>
			<p>My love and admiration is with you always, whatever comes to pass,</p>
			<p>M</p>
			<p>=====[lacuna]=====</p>
			&nbsp;
			<p>My master was an impatient man, and I chafed under his instruction. I was the most rebellious of his
				disciples, he often told me, as he lay the switch across my bottom. The others feared his temper, but
				once I perceived that it was the blaze of his vocation bursting out, my heart caught fire from his.</p>
			<p>When I was but a youth, he sent me into the west, on a mission of reconciliation to several of our young
				outpost communities. Divisions had arisen there concerning certain matters of doctrine, and my master's
				message was intended to reconcile them, <a id="deviants">specifically to enjoin them to reject</a> <a
					href="MPart2.html#deviants">all deviants from the true way</a>. My master was a loving man, but
				intolerant of views other than his own.</p>
			<p>May his spirit forgive me, I can no longer remember what the original disagreement was, but I have no
				trouble recalling how vicious and destructive it had already become by the time I arrived, and how
				wrangling over it eclipsed every other concern. I believed I was an excellent disputer, but quickly
				found that a mere facility with words would not suffice in debate against the brilliant heretics in that
				area who had bewitched many of our fledgling faith.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, despite my years, the authority I bore as legate from my master helped me begin to calm the
				roil of dissension by establishing a kind of tribunal: I persuaded the adversaries to formally present
				their claims, whereafter I would submit them in a letter to my master, and he would render judgment.</p>
			<p>But before the tribunal could be convened, devastating news arrived from the east: my master was dead.
				Worse were the reports of how he left this life. Soldiers of the Golias broke down his door in the
				middle of the night, dragged him from his bed, tortured him savagely, then <a
					id="tortureandexecution">presented him to the mob in the arena the next day</a>, where <a
					href="MPart2.html#tortureandexecution">he was stripped naked, impaled on a stake, and burned
					alive</a>. He was ninety years old.</p>
			<p>I was ready to set out that very day to return to my home, but the elders of the community pleaded with
				me not to leave them, saying first of all that there was nothing I could do for my master, and second
				that I would put myself in danger of coming to the same end. What convinced me to stay, however, was
				their manifest love for me, their anxiety for my safety and well-being, and &mdash; most damning of all
				for me, for it most fed my pride &mdash; their desire that I should take my master's place as their
				spiritual leader.</p>
			<p>Just then a similar persecution erupted in a nearby city, where the leader of what my master certainly
				would have regarded as a heretic sect was also arrested, tortured, and publicly executed. His followers
				fled to our town, where, rather than being given shelter and succor by our congregation, they were
				driven away, into the wilderness, lest the inquisitors of the Golias find them among us and massacre us
				all.</p>
			<p>I was appalled. I vigorously remonstrated with my hosts for their shocking lack of charity towards our
				wayward brethren, and shamed them into going after the refugees to bring them back. But they could not
				be found, then or ever again.</p>
			<p>It was plain to everyone that something had to be done to unite our quarrelsome communities, and once
				again the idea of a tribunal to settle all points of doctrinal antagonism was put forth; some even
				proposed that I sit as arbiter, but I did not yet hold myself in such high regard that I could accept
				that honor and responsibility. Instead, I proposed that we gather our concerns in a petition to the
				Eparch in Golia, and place ourselves under his authority, in hope to gain such protection as he might
				have power to extend over us.</p>
			<p>This plan met with approval, although the composition of the letter itself proved to be as contentious as
				any credal dispute. In the end, however, the petition was finished, and once again the elders of the
				community turned to me to act for all of them, by delivering it to the Eparch myself.</p>
			<p>Why did it never occur to me that this early success might prove my undoing in the end? Because it is
				always easier to learn the hard way, as the Remnant say: those who prove lucky at the beginning of an
				enterprise are deprived of the wisdom that a painful lesson can bring, and those who have no experience
				of the brutal reversals that life can inflict cannot appreciate how quickly and utterly their good
				fortune can turn into its opposite.</p>
			<p><a id="intelligent">I was just such a creature then</a>. <a href="conspiracy.html#intelligent">Young,
					intelligent, articulate</a>, and seemingly wise in penetrating the motives of human beings &mdash;
				when in fact I was merely cunning in debate. I knew many things, but I understood nothing. In any case,
				I took the step I took, and it may be that, had I been wiser then, I would not be here now, where I
				belong. But O what suffering I caused! What awful, irretrievable wreckage I created! I cannot believe
				that that was necessary, just to teach me a lesson.</p>
			<p>But these are pointless maunderings, as I well know, having agonized over them again and again. Best to
				finish the story, if I can.</p>
			<p>For so powerful a personage, at least among our community of believers, the Eparch was, as a man, modest
				and mild. He listened sympathetically to my introduction, read the petition carefully, and then
				questioned me closely about the events that led up to my bringing it to him. He also spoke in sorrow
				about the vile murder of my master, and told me of their friendship, which, though attenuated by
				distance, was deep and abiding.</p>
			<p>But on the subject of my mission, he was evasive &mdash; indeed, he seemed not to comprehend the severity
				of our distress. He explained to me that in his own flock, there was considerable variation of opinion
				on the finer points of doctrine; heresy was less of a problem than avoiding the agents of the Inquirer
				General, <a id="properreverenceforthedeities">whose charge it was to ensure</a> the <a
					href="MPart2.html#properreverenceforthedeities">proper reverence for the Deities</a>, by whose
				authority the Golias was said to rule. This was accomplished by not attracting too much attention, and
				by meeting informally in each other's homes to celebrate our faith. In Golia itself there had been <a
					id="loudmouth">no serious persecution in years, he said</a>, and if <a
					href="HistoriansNotebook.html#loudmouth">the occasional loudmouth got himself dragged off</a> by
				denouncing the gods or calling the Golias a damned soul, this often inspired as much relief as outrage
				among the congregations.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, he did agree to send a letter back with me addressing each of our concerns, and
				assuring us of any assistance he could supply in the future. With that, he kindly but firmly ushered me
				out, saying he hoped that I could occupy myself in the city for a day or two until he could compose his
				response. When that was ready, he would send for me.</p>
			<p>At first I was at a loss to pass the time. There were many diversions in the city for those who have
				nothing better to do than to waste their substance in riotous living, but though today I can see a kind
				of wisdom in living like a flame, I have never had the taste or the talent for that kind of life, and at
				the time I was very censorious, as is the way with all young zealots, especially those who have been
				encouraged by the seeming approval and admiration of their elders.</p>
			<p>I'd been given lodging with the relatives of a family in our congregation, a pious elderly couple who
				lived a quiet life in an out-of-the-way part of the city. Upon returning to their home for the evening
				meal, I found waiting for me in the courtyard a man of my own age who introduced himself as their son,
				and who persuaded me to forego the humble fare of his parents' table and accompany him to a friend's
				abode, where we would dine with other members of the faith that I might otherwise not have a chance to
				meet.</p>
			<p>The residence of this friend of my hosts' son was near the center of the city, in an area of broad
				streets lined with magnificent dwellings. Into one of these we went, and I was immediately swept up into
				<a id="momentofmylife">an experience that utterly changed me</a>, and stood as the <a
					href="AricAftermath.html#momentofmylife">moment of my life</a>, to use the Remnant's formulation,
				until the day of my conversion &mdash; the day that brought me to you, little children.</p>
			<p>=====[lacuna]=====</p>
			&nbsp;
			<p>It did not take long to discover the heart of the festivity. In the large central room, where a robust
				fire was burning, a space had been cleared just beside the hearth, and there a performance was taking
				place &mdash; some kind of recitation, or so it seemed at first. A handsome well-built man with shaggy
				blond hair was speaking in an animated fashion, apparently re-enacting a comical conversation between
				two people he had overheard, or perhaps had composed himself for the entertainment of others, and in
				which he was succeeding definitively.</p>
			<p>I, too, could not resist joining in the laughter, <a id="peculiaraccent">until I finally penetrated</a>
				<a href="conspiracy.html#peculiaraccent">the strange accent</a> this man affected for the more
				ridiculous of the two characters he portrayed. I realized that he was mocking the Eparch himself, and
				the source of most of his humor was the satirical twisting of statements of our creed, which he mangled
				in such a way as to make them completely ludicrous.</p>
			<p>I looked around the room, and saw that only two people were not convulsed with hilarity at this man's
				japings: my new friend, who, while smiling himself, kept glancing at me nervously, and another somewhat
				older man near the side of the performing area, who was regarding me with dark shining eyes. He nodded
				to me slightly, then returned his attention to the performance, which was nearing its climax.</p>
			<p>With a fine thumping phrase, the animated artiste sent the crowd into an explosion of laughter and
				cheering, during which he bowed and capered about, then sat pertly next to the man with the dark eyes,
				who clapped him around the shoulder and clasped his hand.</p>
			<p>I was ready to quit the city then and there, with or without the letter from the Eparch, and started to
				ask my new friend to take me back to his parents' house at once, but the noise was too great to make
				myself understood. And then the host of the gathering interrupted to tell me that another of his guests
				wished to meet me.</p>
			<p>Although I was anxious to leave, my friend and our host made it clear that I really was not at liberty to
				decline. And so I was led into the presence of <a id="darkeyes">the son of the Golias</a>, <a
					href="MPart2.html#darkeyes">the man with the dark shining eyes</a>, and his companion, <a
					id="hisHistorian">whose name I never learned, but whom the young Golias</a> <a
					href="MPart2.html#hisHistorian">called his Historian</a>.</p>
			<p>Both men regarded me with frank interest, and the encounter was also a matter of curious attention from a
				few other guests, though beyond the periphery of our little circle, the raucous party resumed.</p>
			<p>The son of the Golias said he perceived that I was not entirely captivated by his Historian's
				performance. I replied that I was not a qualified judge, being an outlander and unfamiliar with such
				matters.</p>
			<p>He asked how I'd come to be in the city, and I gave a guarded reply, that I'd been sent by associates to
				conduct some business on their behalf.</p>
			<p>'My friend,' he said with a smile, ' &mdash; and I hope you will honor me with your friendship? &mdash; I
				know something of the business that brought you here, and would be glad to help, if I can.'</p>
			<p>I did not know how to respond, so I merely bowed.</p>
			<p>'You seem puzzled, perhaps skeptical. That is wise. What do you know of me, except that the Golias my
				father persecutes your brethren, torturing and executing them in the arena for the enjoyment of the
				rabble? But perhaps that policy can be emended. Would that be a good thing?'</p>
			<p>'Certainly, my lord.'</p>
			<p>'Then I shall see what can be done. But I would be grateful to know what you found offensive in my
				Historian's performance.'</p>
			<p>The Historian himself then spoke up, 'I thrive on criticism, you see &mdash; it keeps my skills at their
				highest pitch.'</p>
			<p>I looked in his face for the first time. His smile seemed sincere, and his voice sounded friendly. But in
				his eyes there was a cool light, as if he were sizing me up as an adversary. I returned his gaze as
				steadily as I could.</p>
			<p>Perceiving this, the Historian smiled more broadly. 'You were going to say...?'</p>
			<p>'It took me some time to recognize the Eparch as the object of your satire,' I began carefully. 'At first
				I could not understand what he was supposed to be saying.'</p>
			<p>'My thoughts exactly,' said the son of the Golias, 'The impersonation was rather crude, my dear.'</p>
			<p>The Historian conceded the point with a sideways nod of his head. 'My first attempt,' he said. 'Too
				primitive. I'll work on it.'</p>
			<p>'I suspect our young friend here would rather you did not &mdash; am I right?' said the young Golias,
				turning to me.</p>
			<p>I stammered, 'The Eparch is a holy man &mdash;'</p>
			<p>'The Eparch,' said the Historian acidly, 'is a fussy old matron &mdash;' but the young Golias laid a hand
				on his arm, and he stopped.</p>
			<p>'The kind of man the Eparch is does not matter,' I shot back. 'It is his Mission &mdash;'</p>
			<p>'The kind of man anyone is always matters,' the Historian returned, a fire kindling in his eyes.</p>
			<p><a id="formeropponent">I found it hard to resist this</a> <a href="MPart2.html#formeropponent">obvious
					personal challenge</a>. It had been some while since my last battle with another mind, as I so much
				enjoyed to do in my master's house. But there I had also learned not to enter the fray until I knew
				something of the terrain. Here I was a stranger, in the presence of one who after all held my life in
				his hands.</p>
			<p>The room grew quiet. Our eyes were locked together. I knew that to break this contact, to glance at the
				young Golias, for example, would be to flinch, and the advantage would go to my opponent, who clearly
				understood the same.</p>
			<p>The silence lengthened. Then there was a slight stirring from where the Golias' son stood. The Historian
				softened his stance, but kept his eyes on me. 'And what kind of man are you, my disapproving young
				friend? What is the Eparch to you that he calls forth such a fiery defense?'</p>
			<p>'Until this day,' I said, as evenly as I could, 'a man worthy only of admiration and respect. What has he
				done to warrant such contempt from a man so prominently placed as yourself?'</p>
			<p>The Historian inclined his head slightly to acknowledge that he may have underestimated me, but there was
				also a kind of warning in his eyes. As I contemplate this moment from the distance of years, I perceive
				that he was perhaps trying to spare me what would follow if I did not back down now, but of course even
				if I'd understood this &mdash; and maybe I did, a little &mdash; it would only have fired my
				self-regard, and I would have done exactly what I did, or worse.</p>
			<p>In the event, he said, 'Forgive me, but are you saying that the leader of an outlawed cult is worthy of
				admiration and respect? Does not his very claim to be the so-called Father of the Faith constitute
				treason against the deities by whose command the Golias rules his people? Is this not a capital
				offense?'</p>
			<p>I was staggered. I had assumed I was at a gathering of friends &mdash; if not fellow believers, at least
				those sympathetic to our ideal. But of course, there was no reason at all for this to be true, as I now
				realized: how did I know that the young man who called himself the son of my hosts was in fact who he
				said he was? &mdash; we never entered the house of his 'parents' together. Had his unexpected appearance
				been a snare laid to have me arrested? Had I been drawn into this very argument in order that I might
				expose myself to my enemies?</p>
			<p>Even were that the case, I thought, my fate was likely already decided, and there would be no shame in
				dying a martyr to the cause. Or so I believe now must have been my reasoning then. In truth, I'd tasted
				this man's blood, and though he'd wounded me in return, I was now intent on finishing him off, or at
				least bringing him down with me when I fell.</p>
			<p>'As he is under the sentence of death,' I said, 'he merits your compassion, not your ridicule. It is like
				jeering at a legless man because he cannot walk.'</p>
			<p>At this moment the young Golias gave a shout of laughter, startling us both and everyone around us as
				well.</p>
