			<p>We have to wonder what form this connection took, so as to be discerned by our Author here: were these connections merely references within newer texts to persons or events narrated in older ones? Or did they take a more sophisticated form than a mere mention in one text to some passage in another?</p>
			<p>We know that, <a id="aconnectionbetweentwoormoreauthors.html">from the time of Egderus, at least</a> <a href="Thescriptorandhisbeloved.html#linktoitsdistantcousin">scriptors and the officials they served employed links between texts</a>, but in the present circumstance, reading in a ruin, is it conceivable that this Author had recourse to such an affordance? If so, how was the bridging of two texts contrived and then enacted?</p>
			<p>Or is 'linking between texts' even the proper way to think about such an association...?</p>
