			<p><a id="hidden">As with Egderus</a>, I start <a href="secrets.html#hidden">this hidden writing</a> in
				secret, since it is unlikely to be found among so much foliage from other trees. I have no hope of
				escaping detection much longer, since my master has started asking me about the archive &mdash; is it
				safe, he wants to know. So far I've been able to reassure him, but the last time I may have overplayed
				my attempt at breezy reassurance. A flicker in his eye, a tensing of the brow &mdash; it may be nothing;
				he is so anxious about other things &mdash; but if I am right, the next time he comes he will ask to see
				what I am working on. I need a decoy, something I have yet to put my mind to...</p>
			<p>I know he loves me and, in his hapless way, wants the best for me. But he is under compulsion himself,
				and I surmise it regards the archive, perhaps only as part of a larger concern among his superiors, who
				themselves may be under pressure from their own masters. I cannot fathom what that concern might be, but
				I do know that I am the one least likely to survive any major upheaval. Indeed, I may be sacrificed
				early in order to stave off just such a disruption, and I imagine my master, whom I know so well, is
				terribly worried about the same thing &mdash; if not for my sake, then for his own: dear man that he is,
				he is too weak to be able to protect these writings from the very people indicted herein.</p>
			<p>Enough preamble. I have been making a copy of every writing in the archive, and until now supplying each
				with as much as I could deduce about its author, the intention in writing it, and the circumstances
				under which it was produced. This is very toilsome, of course, and a great deal of this adminicular
				labor requires guessing, at which I am a poor practitioner. The resulting documentum is becoming
				unwieldy, both in its ideational complexity and its physical cumbersomeness: <a id="oldspelling">notae
					must be inserted into the text</a> of my copy (<a
					href="LegomenonforUNKNOWNCURATOR.html#oldspelling">in a different script, to signify that they are
					notae</a>) or, in the case of an afterthought, attached by means of some device to the writing
				itself. Should I have to leave in haste, I can only dump everything pell-mell into a not very commodious
				bag I have reserved for the purpose.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, the work proceeds, though the pace has necessarily slowed since I arrived at the commentary
				supplied by one of my predecessors, because I now must deal not only with the writing as a Writing, but
				also with the annotation system, which I must say is not entirely systematic.</p>
			<p>But then my predecessor too was operating in stressful conditions &mdash; though it seems that at first
				it was the stress of joyful excitement at making this discovery under the very noses of the wise men of
				the time.</p>
			<p>However, I anticipate &mdash; it is easy to be drawn off the path into the enchantment of a particular
				story, and the archive is rich in such temptations.</p>
			<p><a id="finishcopying">My plan is to</a> <a href="heavilydamageddocument.html#finishcopying">finish
					copying</a> the primary Writings and then find a safe place to hide them &mdash; in fact, I think I
				may transfer the Writings I have already finished, in case</p>
