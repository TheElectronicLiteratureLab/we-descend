			<p>There are two lines of argument concerning what happened to this page (and of course neither can be
				substantiated, because not even the Scholar was working from original textual artifacts):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The page was one of those lost, along with so many others, over the years, through the exigencies of
					archival transmission;</li>
				<li>The page did come loose, and is one of the others included in the Writing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If the latter is true, of course, then the question would have to be: which is the so-called Sticking
				Page?</p>
