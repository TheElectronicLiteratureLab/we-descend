			<p>An apocryphal gloss on this otherwise unknown soldier would have us believe that he had already been named heir apparent to the Praetorship, hence was probably a spy; and therefore he answered, if not to the Golias himself, then to someone powerful enough to have a say in who was to succeed Robenc, should anything happen to him.</p>
			<p>The unknown author of this gloss additionally believed Aric to be Robenc's uncle, which could account for the extraordinary claim this secret mission made on Aric's loyalty.</p>
			<p>As indicated, an apocryphal gloss.</p>
