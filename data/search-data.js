	["a dream of the Great City","I was in the Great City; all my companions were familiar with the place, knew where to go and what to do, but I had never come here, and at first just stood where I found myself, gazing about in wonder: for over the whole scene a spirit of adventure seemed to preside, and with elation if anything I followed the dream where it led me. I was soon joined by a young woman who undertook to be my guide. As the young will sometimes do, she adopted a jocular didactic and over-patient manner towards me, and treated me like a not very bright student who needed to be catechized constantly, making me recapitulate every lesson I was learning under her tutelage. She also required me to describe clearly what I was seeing, and to say what I thought it meant, then rebuked me with sharp questions if she thought I was paying insufficient regard to her instruction. We both found this quite diverting, and our friendship warmed. Our way was crowded and very noisy: powerful music played all around us regardless of where we went. Most remarkable, the streets outside, and the floors within buildings that we entered, all crawled with what looked to be huge insects and many-legged worm-like creatures the size of cats or dogs &mdash; but they were all mechanical, made of filaments of the airiest gleaming metal or spun glass, streaming across the walls and ceilings as well as the tiles and pavements, twining the legs of tables and chairs, sliding swiftly about our feet, and occasionally climbing a short way up our bodies in a delicate exploratory fashion. But no one paid them any mind, and I felt no fear or revulsion &mdash; their touch was gentle, like being brushed by a bird's wing. Our group swelled and shrank as we made our way: at times my guide and I were members of a team working on a project, such as fitting together a structure or device whose purpose we did not know, and then, when it was completed, going separate ways to further tasks or explorations. At other times we stood together in a multitude, observing a performance or some kind of rite in the distance, which was reduplicated in huge mirrors on either side of the platform &mdash; these mirrors reflected and greatly magnified the image and voices of the performers or celebrants, so that we could hear them whisper and detect the subtlest emotions pass across their faces. Only once, or rather more than once in the same place, I was alone. The first time it seemed as if my companion had directed me there, or had sent me off to explore on my own and this is where I fetched up; at a later time, preceding her down a corridor, I opened a door and recognized the place from a previous visit, and said, 'The scene of the crime,' as if in jest, which she then repeated, looking over my shoulder, and in a pointed way, as if in confirmation, 'The scene of the crime.' The place was a tiny, cramped room, not much bigger than a storage closet, on an upper balcony overlooking the street or a large atrium &mdash; it was impossible to tell from our angle of approach. Inside it was equipped like an old-fashioned scriptorium, in the center of which stood a steeply slanted writing desk. Some kind of volume was under preparation upon its surface: the page being worked was inscribed only about halfway down; this page was topmost in a stack about as thick as the end joint of my thumb; another sheaf of pages was fastened to its upper edge, and hung upside-down over the back of the raked inscriptorius; these pages were covered with writings and drawings on both sides, as best I could see from just outside the door. The walls were fitted with shelves all the way from the floor to the ceiling, except for a casement just opposite the desk, where a pebbled-glass window let in hazy light; the shelves were piled &mdash; crammed, really &mdash; with papers, bottles, sacks, hand tools, and books on end; the narrow aisle between the desk and these shelves was further constricted at the corners by binding and cutting devices that stood about chest high. Suspended over the desk was a low chandelier which provided the flickering smoky light of three candle stubs. I don't remember seeing anyone in this room &mdash; indeed, it could hardly accommodate more than one person at a time &mdash; and I cannot tell how many times I returned thither, only that the last time, when I pushed open the door, it stuck, as I was suddenly reminded it always did, and at that I recognized the room, which prompted me to say, in the bantering manner my guide and I had fallen into, 'The scene of the crime,' and I recalled quite clearly all those details of the room's contents I just listed, and so concluded that I had been there before, even though I had no actual memory of walking around inside &mdash; that is, there was no event to which to tie the recollection, so that I could say, 'Ah, this is where that happened!' But, of course, as soon as I said, 'The scene of the crime,' and my companion repeated, in her mock-solemn way, 'The scene of the crime,' I was provided with the very event that permits me now to remember that scene in my dream, and perhaps the whole dream itself. I have often had the sensation, when absorbed in this or that writing in the archive, that I actually lived at the time it describes, in that place, among those persons. Others have told of having the same feeling, and this mental phenomenon is often ascribed to the vividness of the writing that gives rise to it. It is true of course that bad writing, with its distracting errors, worn-out phrases, imprecisions, and mishaps of expression, can rarely if ever invoke this sense of utter familiarity. But it is also the case that truly brilliant writing can be distracting in much the same way, calling attention to itself and away from what it is attempting to convey &mdash; or rather, as it is a beautiful thing in itself, we gaze at it rather than the scene for which it is but the messenger, like an angel whose glory is so dazzling that we cannot comprehend the message it has come to deliver. No, this feeling of recollection comes from within; it is not called forth by some external stimulus, or not only by that, but by an inner need &mdash; and this need is fulfilled, however briefly and imperfectly, when it meets another's inner need to speak, to tell how it is with them, and with those from whom they came, or were sent. It is the need that is utterly familiar, and that meeting is like the one described by those who say that falling in love is not discovering the love of their life but recognizing the person they have always been in love with. Even if &mdash; need it be said? &mdash; they have never met before.","1adreamoftheGreatCity.html"],
	["archive under threat","As with Egderus, I start this hidden writing in secret, since it is unlikely to be found among so much foliage from other trees. I have no hope of escaping detection much longer, since my master has started asking me about the archive &mdash; is it safe, he wants to know. So far I've been able to reassure him, but the last time I may have overplayed my attempt at breezy reassurance. A flicker in his eye, a tensing of the brow &mdash; it may be nothing; he is so anxious about other things &mdash; but if I am right, the next time he comes he will ask to see what I am working on. I need a decoy, something I have yet to put my mind to... I know he loves me and, in his hapless way, wants the best for me. But he is under compulsion himself, and I surmise it regards the archive, perhaps only as part of a larger concern among his superiors, who themselves may be under pressure from their own masters. I cannot fathom what that concern might be, but I do know that I am the one least likely to survive any major upheaval. Indeed, I may be sacrificed early in order to stave off just such a disruption, and I imagine my master, whom I know so well, is terribly worried about the same thing &mdash; if not for my sake, then for his own: dear man that he is, he is too weak to be able to protect these writings from the very people indicted herein. Enough preamble. I have been making a copy of every writing in the archive, and until now supplying each with as much as I could deduce about its author, the intention in writing it, and the circumstances under which it was produced. This is very toilsome, of course, and a great deal of this adminicular labor requires guessing, at which I am a poor practitioner. The resulting documentum is becoming unwieldy, both in its ideational complexity and its physical cumbersomeness: notae must be inserted into the text of my copy (in a different script, to signify that they are notae) or, in the case of an afterthought, attached by means of some device to the writing itself. Should I have to leave in haste, I can only dump everything pell-mell into a not very commodious bag I have reserved for the purpose. Nonetheless, the work proceeds, though the pace has necessarily slowed since I arrived at the commentary supplied by one of my predecessors, because I now must deal not only with the writing as a Writing, but also with the annotation system, which I must say is not entirely systematic. But then my predecessor too was operating in stressful conditions &mdash; though it seems that at first it was the stress of joyful excitement at making this discovery under the very noses of the wise men of the time. However, I anticipate &mdash; it is easy to be drawn off the path into the enchantment of a particular story, and the archive is rich in such temptations. My plan is to finish copying the primary Writings and then find a safe place to hide them &mdash; in fact, I think I may transfer the Writings I have already finished, in case [Fragment ends here &mdash; Ed.]","1archiveunderthreat.html"],

	["deities","The deities... I sang to them; I adored them. I attended them in their unimaginable abode; I prayed to them in the silence of my heart, picturing them one by one as I called to mind, one by one, the things I need, the things I want, the things I've been taught to ask for. I was their acolyte: a wonderful life. I owned nothing, required nothing, desired nothing, except to spend each day adoring them. I dwelt forever in paradise itself. Then came the others. I had seen them before, but only with each other: they had never come to me. But when at last they did, they bore me away with them, wherever they went, and they went everywhere. And wherever I was taken with them, they thought of other places, and made plans to go there; they remembered places they had been before, and arranged to return. Nowhere we went did we ever arrive. And everywhere they went, they brought their gear; they contrived to bring their families and friends with them, in their gear, just as they were taken by their families and friends in their gear, wherever they went; their dear ones were with them always, everywhere they went, and so were their heroes, their enemies, their bosses, their underlings. They spoke constantly: of love, of anger, and of fear; of time, and of distance; they devised great constructions of their speakings, on these topics and on others, and linked them together into a majestic discourse. They poured from one place to another, their faces shining as in sunlight; but the light did not come from the sun, upon which they no longer gazed by day, nor upon the moon and the stars by night, but rather they gazed upon images of these wondrous objects captured by devices they had contrived for this purpose, and the devices displayed them by means of their own light, so that the images could be studied and described and linked together as well. And they exclaimed over what they had done, and were doing, and would do in days to come; they exclaimed and exclaimed, and could not stop; and multitudes joined them, from everywhere else that there was, exclaiming in their turn, joining their voices to those of the multitudes they encountered in a ringing cry of amazement and wonder at all that they had made and joined together, causing the sky to thunder with their noise. I heard the heavens ring with a mighty sound, but when I looked up, I saw only the moon and the stars by night, and the bright sun by day. Clouds drifted before them, then passed slowly away; trees waved in the wind, then were still in the cool of the evening; water surged and ebbed along the shore, hissing softly like a sigh. I turned round, and knew that I had dreamed, for the earth was empty, the deities silent. I was alone, and at peace.","1deities.html"],
	["Egderus at Mountain House","Here beginneth the Testament of Egderus, 9th Superius Frater of Mountain House, in the 50th season of his tenure. May he be shielded from illness and disaster, until it be completed. ... At that time Robenc was Phylax at Mountain House. Officially he commanded the stratioti of the garrison, but also he reported to the old Golias upon the doings of the Superius Frater. But the Superius was shrewd, where Robenc was young and rather naive... ... At first I found it hard to be away from my mother, whom I would never see again, and whose stories I told myself over and over at night in order to fall asleep. But the Superius took me under his wing, asking me to do things for him, treating me with kindness and asking my advice on many subjects, even though there could hardly be anything that I could teach him. Only once did I see him become perturbed about anything, and that was when Robenc came to Mountain House. The House had always been guarded by stratioti &mdash; soldiers &mdash; who lived in the outbuildings and patrolled the paths and roads. There were five stratioti and the Phylax, their commanding officer, and they kept watch in pairs in quarter-day shifts. The man who was Phylax when I first arrived was named Gig, and he terrified us all because of his fierce appearance and awful temper. Off duty he was often drunk, and sometimes chased the younger brothers with his axe. Gig never entered the House, so if we could prevent Gig from ever getting between us and the House, we could usually escape without much trouble. But Gig was sly as well as mean, and would sometimes surprise one of us out on a trail, and then a fearsome chase would ensue. To my knowledge he never caught anyone, though occasionally a slight injury was incurred in trying to get away from him. He never came after me, perhaps because I could not run, and so chasing me would give him no pleasure. But one day he did catch me out in the open. I was on my way to meet the Superius Frater, who had gone down the mountain to meet with the Golias. The Prior, who liked to be called The Good Doctor, sent me to make the hour's walk to the Gatehouse because, he said, he could spare no one else, and he was not going to spoil me like the Superius did. About halfway between the House and the Gate, the road drops off steeply on the left hand side while a rocky bank rises just as steeply on the right. Gig jumped out from behind an outcropping, roaring like a bear. In my terror I turned too quickly, my leg collapsed, and I tumbled onto my back. Gig loomed over me and raised his axe. Even if I had not been paralyzed with fright, I could never have escaped this giant man. But when he saw my face, he jumped back as if he himself were terrified. His axe clattered on the paving stones, and he looked as if he was going to run. I must have let out a cry or made some sound, for he came to himself, and grabbed up his axe, raising it again over me. I covered my face with my arms, certain that I was about to die. He grunted once, and I heard the axe whizz through the air. My ears began to ring like the inside of the bell tower, and sparkling golden light washed over me. I awoke on a cot in the infirmary. The Superius Frater himself was dozing on a chair beside me. He told me he had found me lying in the middle of the road on his way back from the town. When he asked me what had happened, for some reason I didn't want to tell him, at least not until I'd had a chance to ponder it for a while. So I pretended I could not remember anything since before he left for town that morning. After a day or so I was able to resume my duties, and it was then I learned that Gig had disappeared. The stratioti were more irritable than usual &mdash; each had to pull double-shifts to cover Gig's absence &mdash; but they also were frightening the younger brothers with stories of demons lurking in the woods. And of course the off-duty stratioti would want to hunt for Gig, and would press anyone they could into service. A week later poor Brother Anders found a limbless torso beside the Spring. He ran back to the House, his hair still on end, and told us what had happened: as he was filling the buckets, what he thought was a large rock hit the roof of the spring house, then bounced into the weeds beside the path. Curious, he had gone to look at it. I could not walk so far, so I did not see the scene which awaited the party of brothers and stratioti who returned to the Spring, but Brother Anders told me about it: a brief search of the woods turned up two arms without hands and two legs without feet; Anders was unfortunate enough to find Gig's head balanced on top of a boulder just off the path. He had never seen such an expression on a human face, he said, and never wanted to again. But more than that, he prayed that he would never have to see what that face was looking at. I never saw the head or the rest of the body, but I believe I had seen the look that Brother Anders described. And Gig was looking at me.","1EgderusatMountainHouse.html"],

	["Foreword to the Archives","Imagine you are poking around in someone's attic, where you discover an old linen trunk, and when you open it, you find it is crammed full of notebooks and loose documents &mdash; and some of them look very old. You read a few of those on top, or read at them, just to see what they are about, and begin to wonder how they might be connected: sometimes you perceive a link here and there &mdash; a name appears in more than one writing, maybe, or now and then some dates seem to line up &mdash; but most of the individual texts are just that: singletons that don't relate to each other at all, or not that you can see, so far... But, you reflect, they all ended up here, together like this; how did that happen? because of course every writing has another story in addition to the one it tells: how did it get from the author to you? Tracing that second story back to its source, you realize that of course there's a third story to be discovered, or discerned: how did this document come to be composed in the first place? how does it fit in with the story of the author's life? And so on: as the Remnant say, no end of stories and their stories. One of the many pleasures of exploring an archive takes place at the very beginning, before you have any comprehension of its overall structure or extent. In that moment, every new thing you discover is itself alone, you know nothing about it to begin with except what it says about itself, you don't know where to go when you finish reading it, but it feels like every step you take, in whatever direction, is progress. After a while, an impression of context begins to emerge: you now perceive a writing as being in among other writings, whose only connection at first was that you were reading them, but you start to feel them talking to each other, if only in your recollection of them, so you go back and reread this one, then that one &mdash; and you start to perceive structure as well as content, how they resemble each other, or differ in this or that respect. At this point the pure experience which Egderus describes as reading 'something bright and right and beautiful for the first time' gives over, more and more, to the forensic activities of the investigator, which of course have their own pleasures, but they are quite distinct. One gets to know a person in just this way, is it not so? And so, you are invited into the company of just these persons, whose writings address you, whom they imagined, and longed for enough to tell just these stories, in just this way, and for whom they have waited until now, when you appeared, just as they hoped you would.

	["in the Keep","My Keeper took some pleasure in interrogating me. I knew well what he was doing, perhaps better than he: asking questions that made no sense; commanding me to explain why I had done things I had not done, and about which I knew nothing; moving me from place to place, but all underground, so that I would lose all sense of time; allowing me only enough rest so that I could survive the next session; and so on. He plainly appreciated that torment of the mind is more effectual than violence to the body: I was given moldy bread and foul water, and deprived of any covering but the filthy night garment in which I had been arrested, but although the guards were quite rough when they hauled me to and fro in the Keep, they never struck me or hurt me in any other way. He also showed considerable intuition in teasing out my weaknesses: his probings rarely failed to produce some outburst of impatience or indignation, and this gratified him greatly, as if I had disclosed essential information &mdash; which, in the way of these things, I had just done. I confess I was fascinated by this reversal of roles, at how easily I lost a grip on my feelings &mdash; and it made no difference that I knew exactly what he was doing, could even predict when he would do it. Naturally he never left me alone long enough to regain my composure, to steel myself for the next onslaught. But my Keeper and I also knew well that the longer our sessions went on, the more durable my resistance might become; in such matters, it is imperative to crack the Client's spirit before his weakness finds its strength. And my tormentor, though able, even talented, was unseasoned, his eagerness in his work too unfocused and raw. I could tell that he was personally concerned in this matter. When he saw me see this in him, it was an electrifying moment for us both. Even I, with my greater experience, did not expect the cunning of his next gambit. He humbly asked me to evaluate his technique. He said he had long been in awe of me: I was a legend. He said he considered it a personal honor to be allied with me; he said, in fine, that he would much prefer for me to be his teacher than his prisoner. When I merely gaped at him, he did exactly what I would have done: he directed the Bone-Snapper to break my thumbs. Of course this was not necessary, for in that moment my will shattered and I gave up, gave in, surrendered to whatever torture lay in store, even welcomed it &mdash; not because I deserved it: I deserved nothing, I was entitled to nothing, there was nothing left to me to defend &mdash; &mdash; and my heart flooded with love. Little children, this is how helpless we are. We armor ourselves with possessions, with alliances, with principles; we shake these things in each other's faces, hackles raised, quivering with wrath; we huddle together in families, in nations, in mobs; we say 'this but not that', we say 'you but not your brother', we say 'us', we say 'them'. We say 'save us!', we say 'No.' I do not know how much longer I remained in the Keep &mdash; probably not long. I seem to remember being bathed like a baby in warm water and sweet-smelling soap by two cooing women who dried me and wrapped me in a soft blanket, then rolled me into bed, where I must have slipped immediately into dreamless sleep &mdash; unless the whole experience was a dream. At some later moment I was led out of doors into brilliant sunlight, a pack was loaded onto my back, straps cinched around my shoulders, a staff put into my hand. Then I was alone.

Or where the 'terrorist' that was supposed to be with them had gone? Only he wasn't with them &mdash; we knew what he looked like, which was nothing like any of them. Bastard probably lit out from a whole nother side of town and was halfway to the moon by now. But there those two were, hiding in a gully no more than fifty paces out on the moor, an old woman and a girl nine or ten; the little one had diarrhea, and the old one was trying to help her, however she thought that was supposed to work. At least the girl wasn't vomiting, or the noise would've brought somebody else, one of the nasty proper [expletives] who like chopping people up, not an ordinary human fool like me. Didn't know why in that moment, but instead of ratting them out I made a big show of scanning the horizon and checking every bush, at the same time signaling the old one to stay put and make no sound. By the time I got back to the grove, the rest of her group had been butchered and the whole [expletive] place was going up, and I had to make a long run around it to catch up with the platoon, which was moving out double-time &mdash; no doubt the idea was to get as far from here as we could before nightfall. Something slipped out of my pack as I jogged over the clumps, but I couldn't see what it was, and after a quick look I just kept going. But as I ran, a voice inside kept telling me to [expletive] the platoon, [expletive] the lieutenant, let them all go, let them get away from me, let me get away from them &mdash; I hated lieutenant, I hated both sergeants, but most I hated the rest of the stupid jerks who just did whatever they were told, no matter how gruesome or perverted. No; no: the very worst of all I hated myself for going along with the rest of them, the sick sadistic [expletives]. I kept falling further back, until somebody must have noticed I wasn't with them, and they stopped. So I stopped too, breathing heavy and holding my side like I had a stitch. I waved at them to go on, but [expletive] lieutenant sent some poor juvenile [expletive] back towards me. By that time I had my pack off and was rummaging in it, and found out my mess kit was what fell out. But I also snuck my weapon off and hid it under the pack before the kid was close enough to see me do it, and I yelled at him to go ahead without me, I'd catch up. He just stood there like the dumb [expletive] he was, like he couldn't comprehend what I was saying, so I told him I'd lost my weapon and had to go back and look for it. I was raised in woods like this, I told him, I'll be able to track you, tell sergeant I'll be fine and see you all tomorrow if it gets too dark today. He jogs back to the sergeant, who blows up in his face, and then starts towards me himself, still yelling, but I pretend I don't understand him and keep motioning they should go on without me. In a moment, lieutenant calls the sergeant back, and they jaw for a bit, while I keep looking around on the ground as if searching real hard. Then the poor grunt's headed back towards me again and the platoon's moving out the other way, so I run up to the poor sod, curse him good, make him understand I'm not gonna have a silly punk [expletive] like him trying to 'help me' and getting us both killed or at least hurt, and in the end I just threatened to pound the [expletive] out of him if he didn't get the [expletive] away from me and let me go find my weapon before it was the middle of the night. He looked like he might argue, but I could see he was scared of losing the group, so I told him not to worry, blame it on me, he didn't have to get [expletived] just because I couldn't keep track of my [expletive] weapon. He said he'd murder me if he got in trouble for this, but he was already turning away and I said as kindly as I could that that sounded good to me. As soon as all of them were out of sight I put my pack back on, grabbed up my weapon from where I'd hid it, and headed back to the fire. It was really getting dark, but I'd be [expletived] if I wasn't going to find that old woman and the little girl. I stopped for a good long time to hear if anyone was following, but it looked like I was going to get away with this, so I hiked around the fire again and went back to the gully, and there they still were, the little girl all twisted up in agony. She'd die from it if I didn't help, and then the other one would catch it and she'd die too. But I had some medicine in my pack, even if I'd lost my rations. When I came up on them, the old one had a good-looking stick ready for me, and I'm not sure I would have prevailed if she came at me with it. But I put down my weapon and took off my pack and held both hands up, and then I tried some sign language to tell her I had medicine, which she seemed to understand, so I got it out of my pack and and gave her a bit, some for the girl and some for her, and signaled she should take it with water from my flask. She signed back I should take some first, which I realized was a good idea, so I did, and then she gave the same amount to the girl and took the rest herself. The girl was an awful mess, so I pulled my other undershirt out of my pack and between us we got her mostly cleaned up with it. Then I took it back to the fire and threw the filthy [expletive] in. While the medicine took effect, the old one sort of hunkered there petting the girl, and I stayed at the top of the bank to make sure no one was coming back after me. The fire was getting really hot now, and some of the heath was starting to catch, so we'd have to move out right smart or get cooked in the gully. But then I noticed tracks leading out onto the moor and went over to see where they went. I couldn't really tell how old they were, but they didn't look quite fresh, though they could have been today's, and they were headed towards the mountains, which were too dark to see now but I remembered looking at them across the moor when we first got to the grove. I was in truth brought up near woods and waste like this, and I do know how to stay alive out here, but I never let lieutenant nor anyone else know that, because then I'd've gotten to be useful to them, and that just makes trouble for a person. Besides, what the [expletive] did I care what any one of those [expletive] [expletives] thought of me? In a moment the old one came up out of the gully with the girl in her arms, staggering a little, so I strapped on my weapon and took the girl fom her, while the old one went and got my pack and came back with it on her shoulders, and we started off. I tried to follow the tracks, but once we got away from the fire it was just too dark, so I set a course best I could by dead reckoning, hoping the tracks didn't change direction too much once they got out on the moor. After about an hour I could tell the old one was fit to drop, so I halted us and scouted around in the heath until I found a fair spot with an overhang under a crag that was sheltered from the wind, and also invisible from the direction of the fire. I got the two of them settled, then climbed up the side of the crag so I could see what was what back the way we came. It was a breezy night with no moon, but the clear sky was magnificent. The River of Stars, as a kind of sick joke, came right up out of the fire on the horizon, which by now was blazing high. I watched it for a long time, for I was sure that if anyone came in our direction, I'd be able to see their silhouette against the flames. After a good long look, I went back down and found them both asleep, the old one sitting with her back against the crag, the little one curled against her with her arms folded up, the old one's arms around her. I unrolled my blanket and spread it over them; the old one opened her eyes and I signed that I would be up above. She nodded, but almost as soon as her eyes went shut her mouth fell open and she started to snore. On top of the crag again, I finally took a deep breath and began to face up to what I'd just done. I don't need to go into what they'd do to me if, unlikely as it seemed at the moment, lieutenant changed his mind and sent a detail back to find out what happened to me. He was a creep and mean, sure enough, but he wasn't a smart soldier, so I judged he wouldn't really get worried about me till morning and I hadn't showed up, and then he'd likely figure I wasn't worth the trouble, which would be true. But even if he thought it all the way through, and realized it would be better all around if he made sure I wouldn't make any trouble for him, we still were probably safe for a day or so, and by that time I hoped to have things fixed so nobody'd find us, ever. I'd been with that debased [expletive] long enough to observe how he did things: what was most important to him was looking good, or at least not be reckoned responsible if something went wrong, and this whole mission was tailor-made to [expletive] his career in a maximum kind of way. If he went to the captain and reported what had actually happened, and on top of that we didn't capture the [expletive] 'terrorist' the captain had sent us after, not only would lieutenant be busted down to no rank at all, he'd be sweating out the rest of his tour in a cell with two cots and three amorous giants. I didn't know how he'd do it, but I did know that by the time he got back to base in the town, lieutenant would have a terrific story: not only would he take credit for catching the bugger everybody was looking for, but he also would have faked up some kind of evidence that the bugger was dead and in a way he richly deserved and nobody'd have to worry about him ever again. The two sergeants would of course back up this tall tale, because they were just as evil and lazy as he was, only not so smart. And they'd all get promotions, maybe medals, plus the thanks of a grateful nation. I just wished there was something more I could do to help make sure that that was exactly how it worked out, because then we'd all be safe, bugger included, and by this time all I wanted in this life was to get out of range of people like lieutenant and his goons and the so-called people they answered to. If I could bring a couple souls away with me, so much the better. And that's why I just about had a stroke when I saw a silhouette come between me and that fire. I watched for the longest time, not even breathing, until I realized the silhouette was getting shorter, not taller, as it would have done if whoever it was was coming our way. And there was only one of them, which wasn't like lieutenant at all &mdash; he'd have sent at least four. Of course, they could be spread out, and only one of them between the fire and me. But there was no mistaking it: there was a man, walking back and forth in front of that burning stand of trees, but generally moving in its direction, not towards us. Then I realized who it had to be: the bugger everybody was looking for.   So I decided we should wait, see what that shadow did. My native lack of optimism told me not to trust this hopeful interpretation &mdash; that it was the bugger and not one of lieutenant's enforcers out there &mdash; it just felt too much like good luck, and everybody knows how stupid it is to believe anything good'll come out of anything, until after it already has and you got two witnesses to certify it. And even then they could be wrong or lying. After a while, the shadow got too small to pick out from the flicker&mdash; for all I could tell, the crazy bugger had walked right into the [expletive] fire. I decided to stop wondering what he was doing, since I wasn't ever going back to that place to find out, but I'd keep as close a watch as I could, and if he returned this way, on the morrow maybe, we'd keep well hid until he was past, then follow him, in case he knew some place to go.   My daddy and my uncle were soldiers too, and they told me that when you're on a watch like I was, and you know it could go on a good while, it's best not to start thinking about things, because you get absorbed in that, and next thing you know you've gone to sleep or the thing you started out watching for is right on top of you and you're just about to be dead or wishing you were. So they taught me that what you do is you make up a little song, as you're watching, about what you're looking at, every moment &mdash; don't work at it, only tell it: what you see, what you hear, what you smell and touch and feel &mdash; and only that. Not what any of it means, nor what you hope will happen, nor what you're afraid will happen, just what IS happening, moment by moment, only what's THERE. You don't need to sing it out loud, but you do need to move your mouth around the words, and it needs to be a song, not a saying, because it's the song part that keeps you from drifting off into some [expletive] dream about how things might be or ought to be or could be if only but aren't just yet. So I worked on my little ongoing ditty and the wind died down and seven kinds of bugs came out to sing backup for me and the fire leveled out on top and then the moon rose out of it, smoky gold at first and huge but then whitening until it cleared the flames and sailed up the sky, the top left side of its face sort of flattened a little as if from a blow. And now the black moor resolved into shapes where the ground rose and fell, like the bottom of a lake when the water's drained out, and the wind came up again as the moon climbed higher, and stirred the lakebed of light as if stroking its fur, and the River of Stars retired for the night now its relief had showed up, and the bugs' song changed in response to a more silvery key. And my heart began to stir and I knew I'd done the right thing; but it was them that saved me, those two girls clinging to each other down below, and I could never leave them now. Just then a nightbird shrieked off to my left as if to poke me back awake, and I pulled it into my song, and thanked it for keeping me on my mission, which was to make sure that neither that crazy bugger out there nor no one else brought any more harm to my new friends. Nor to me, of course.   It started to rain just before dawn, and once it was light the old one climbed up, bringing my blanket, for which I was grateful, then she went back down. Somehow from the gibberish she spoke to me I understood that the girl was better and they were safe from the wet, and she seemed to understand from the gibberish I said back to her that I needed to stay here a bit longer but wasn't going to run off and leave them alone in the wilderness. She also brought me a handful of purple berries that she said were real tasty and filled you up and they were and they did. The rain put the fire out way over there and then nothing happened for a long time, and I judge I must have fallen asleep for a while, but then I saw someone moving around that smoking campsite and again my heart started thundering because this would be just about the time lieutenant's thugs might show up if they really were coming back for me. But I only saw the one person, moving here and there around the perimeter of what had burned, disappearing into what was left of the woods now and then, but coming out again a little distance away, like he was inspecting a battlefield, though you could hardly call what happened there a battle &mdash; those poor folks put up no fight at all, it was just a massacre. The old one came up again, and I knew it was time for a pow-wow. I was pretty sure that person out there wouldn't try to travel in the rain, and I'd got to thinking I could stand to dry out a little myself, so I went back down with her and found the girl awake but looking real washed out, and since we weren't going anywhere either just at the moment, I built a fire in our little shelter &mdash; I was sure the smoke wouldn't show in all this rain &mdash; and we all sat around it and got our fronts at least warm. The old one and I went back and forth speaking our customary nonsense, and the girl clung to her and stared at me but after a while she fell back asleep and pretty soon I was dozing myself. Not much happened after that. The rain stopped and I went back up to my 'watchtower', but nothing was moving in any direction, so I came back down and told the old one and the girl I was going to try to find us a bit to eat. The old one pointed towards something on the heath &mdash; as best I could tell there was a particular bush out there she wanted me to look at. When I got to it, I saw what she meant: it was a butcherbird's larder, with a field mouse and a little toad stuck on thorns about chest high. I plucked them off, exciting their owner, who screamed at me something awful, and took them back under the crag, where the old one stabbed them onto the end of a forked stick and held them over the fire. Then she shooed me out to go find some more, just like she was my mother, which I kind of liked, and it made me smile, and her too. I picked more of those purple berries and then a grasshopper jumped right into my hand, which made the old one laugh out loud when I showed her how I caught it. My reward was that I got to eat it for breakfast, while she fed the bird to the girl and took the toad herself, peeling off the skin with my knife first, of course. Not much of a feast, but it was meat, and the berries made a very fine second course. Then the girl wanted me to do the grasshopper story again, so I did, and then we all had a good laugh. I haven't laughed like that since they took me in the army, and that was years ago. Well, I'm not in the army any more, whatever else happens.   I got to thinking again about that person back at the campsite, and went up the crag to have another look. I watched for a long time and thought I saw something move there once or twice, but couldn't be sure. Question now was what to do, stay or go? I had a feeling, if that really was the man the captain wanted us to find, he might prove an ally, and we'd all have a better chance of surviving, with him and me together able to hunt. Then again, he just might be the terrorist everybody thought he was and would kill us all in our sleep, girls too, girls especially. Speaking of the girls, did he know them? Was he running with them, like the captain was sure he was? If so, where the [expletive] was he when we came screaming out of the woods and started slaughtering his friends left and right? Out on the moor relieving himself? or running away, until he saw the fire? What was this guy's story? Then I saw him for sure, bending over and straightening up out away from the burning, looked like he was retching onto the ground. Well, if it was the [expletive] I'm thinking he was, and he had been running with those people, I could see why he was spewing his insides out now. Not much of a terrorist, though, if so. Of course I knew none of the stuff I was coming up with now. Only way to find out the case was to get the old one up here for a look, if the [expletive] would still be out there by the time I fetched her back. If she could see that far. But I had to try, because if she recognized him, her reaction would tell me what to do next. We did have to get out of here; question was, with him or without him?   No resolution: I brought her back up, then couldn't get her to understand what I wanted her to see, and the guy had disappeared again, so after a time we just gave up. Can't wait around here any longer. I just can't believe my luck, not getting caught so far. I know that isn't how luck works &mdash; the way luck works is any [expletive] way it feels like, and maybe we could just sit here the rest of our lives eating bugs and toads and no one would bother us ever again. But I've been thinking that even if the story lieutenant trumped up was convincing enough to make the Ancients weep, captain won't settle for No Corpse. So sooner or later Someone will be Back. And we need to be Not Here when That Happens. If that [expletive] terrorist has any sense he'll figure that out for himself. Good: maybe we'll run into him out there...","1purpleberries.html"],
	["return","On a mountain, at dusk, deep fog thinning. As it clears, across from me, a taller peak, near-full moon coming up behind. A flash to the side of me: there, a falls of water, at my level, shining &mdash; and, from above, the River of Stars dropping into it out of the dark. Moon pulls clear: I know that mountain. On its top, a tower, falling down &mdash; I climbed that tower, often. I remember more: a path goes over the far side, down to the lake. The House at one end. Start tomorrow.   Cannot sleep. Every move to set up camp, a sharp image: his hands, his voice, teaching me how. And then, as my fire starts to catch: I am looking from a hiding place; he feeds twigs one by one into young flames, then small sticks, making a pyramid. It begins to glow: he stops moving, gazes into it. His attention shifts; I draw back. He turns his head slowly... looks right at me. A moment passes. Then he lifts his hand, beckons. Now my fire is going, and I gaze. A different scene: glare of sun on deep snow. We've set out for wood, across the lake, iced solid. He plunges, knee-deep in the powder, pulling me on a sledge, his bag of tools on my lap. We head for the far end, where birch and young pine crowd the margin. I'm laughing, he leaps and charges, clowning for me. Then, beyond him, a cloud of steam. I point, shout. He just capers more madly. Then he sinks past his waist, the sledge rams his chest. I pitch over him into soggy slush. I scrabble to get behind him, I'm screaming, I pull and pull on his collar, but I cannot move him. He rouses and flails, yells at me to back away, we'll both go down. I fetch a long handle, he gets the other end, inches up onto solid ice, slithers away from the hole. Staggers to his knees, grabs my shoulder, pushes up to his feet. No wood that day, so no fire when we get back to the House. He wraps us together in everything we can find; I fall asleep against his chest. But I'm too small to warm him. His legs never work again. I scavenge what little wood I can; he becomes very ill. Day after day after day. The misery is appalling. Suddenly it is spring. The birds get up their racket, squirrels chase through the woods. Briars turn green, make flowers then berries, and we feed ourselves again. I learn to work the traps, fish in the lake, to use the sling, and knock down a slow bird then kill a young coney. He rigs the sledge with wheels, to get around the house; I clear a path to the sunporch. He teaches me to plant; in early summer we lay a table beside the lake. For a while it is very good with us &mdash; for all we know, the last ones left on earth. Those words come from him. Young as I am then, I know what it means for us to be that. Different now, of course. Evening, after supper, sun going down. He talks about before he found me in the woods. His friends, his family, others, all elsewhere, unreachable. We sit long after dark in the ruin; even I can tell it was once the palace of a king, or a race of them. I see his face, lit from the side, eyes fixed in that other world; the music of his voice, as he summons the ones he knew into this unpeopled place, where everything he loved was taken away from him. Nothing left but a foundling to watch him die.","1return.html"],
	["ridiculous happenstance","According to a clearly corrupt but nonetheless plausible variant of this Writing, the Golias himself, early in his reign, put down a rebellion in a defiant village in the mountains. When the fighting was over, the inhabitants were herded into the town square, whereupon the ringleaders were 'tried' for treason, and a sentence of death pronounced upon their alleged captain. Disdaining to carry out the sentence himself, the Golias commanded the first able-bodied citizen upon whom his eyes alit to behead the man on the spot. That citizen, the town smith, seems to have been this Author's father (or grandfather, or great-grandfather). From that moment the only employment the former smith or any of his family could find was that of executioner, whose duties at the time also comprised non-lethal punishments such as amputation, branding, and flogging, as well as the dislocation of joints and breaking of bones &mdash; hence, perhaps, the waggish (but frightful) cognomen 'Bone-Snapper'.","1ridiculoushappenstance.html"],

In my case, the reasons for hiding this collection of musings and memories will be all too obvious to my peers (if any survive) or former colleagues (to whom my existence, if any are aware of it, would be at most an annoyance, like an unpleasant smell). Let us just say that my contemporaries and those who follow shortly after are better off knowing nothing of this account. I did consider crafting this Writing as a cautionary tale, but there is nothing to be gained &mdash; no insight that might edify, no warning that would avail.

Thunder had tracked us all morning, and just as we emerged from the forest on the bluff above the river, the clouds ripped open and we were drenched. After less than an hour, we came around a bend in the road and entered the courtyard of a small inn, where we would spend the night and then in the morning climb down to the crossing. Once I'd stowed my luggage in a corner of the dormitory, I wandered into the meditation hall and found a stairway that led up to the covered watch-platform, and from there I gazed across the broad river to the fantastic towers on the other bank. I had never seen a settlement so large &mdash; upstream, the jumble of buildings spread all the way to the horizon; in the other direction, the river mouth opened into an extensive harbor whose shores were lined with piers and boat-slips as far as could be seen. In the center of the harbor, like a jewel, sat the Isle of the Temple, the eternal fire blazing at its pinnacle despite the pouring rain. I nearly fell to my knees in gratitude for this moment &mdash; the moment of my life, surely &mdash; the culmination of my life's work. The moment of my life it certainly proved to be, in a way I could not yet imagine, and whose sudden recollection still catches me unawares, as I ponder this existence, and the perfidy of my kind &mdash; and my own silly innocence, that provided the occasion for such a bitter lesson. I returned to my lodging and spent the few hours before nightfall preparing my presentation. Indeed, I had already dedicated days and days to marshalling my my arguments, practicing my speech, even rehearsing my answers to the questions and counter-arguments I was certain I would have to face, and was confident I could foresee. ===[lacuna (redacted?): some days seem to have passed...]===   Shortly after departing the inn the next morning, I turned for a last look at the Temple and its precincts. Even though the sun had only just risen behind the majestic towers of the city, the air was warm, bespeaking a hot day to come, and a fine mist carpeted the harbor, blurring somewhat the image of the little islet in its midst. There was no hurry for me, of course, but I knew that my companions were anxious to cover as much distance as possible before the heat of the day fell full upon us, so I did not linger. But just before turning my face in our journey's direction, I thought I observed a traveler appearing at the inn's gate &mdash; I assumed to ask for entry, but I was too absorbed in my own thoughts to pay further attention. An hour or more might have gone by before I thought to glance back the way we came, but when I did I noticed melancholy contemplation. It may have been another hour before I came out of my stupor. The sun had climbed midway to the meridian, the air was becoming close, and the man was maneuvering in his narrow seat, endeavoring to take off his outer garment, when his hand knocked against my knee, for which he begged my pardon. I nodded again, noting absently his inviting smile, but remained silent. Then our cart suddenly pulled up short; he was caught off-balance and fell almost into my lap. He apologized vigorously, and, perhaps to cover his embarrassment, leaped out of the carrier and jogged off toward the front of our train, evidently to discover the reason for our halting so abruptly. In a moment he returned to say that there was another convoy coming towards us on the opposite side of the bridge up ahead, and the two guides were negotiating who would cross first. It made little difference to me &mdash; I would be no less miserable sitting still than moving onward, and communicated this to him with a shrug. He looked at me a moment, and then, having made some decision, said firmly, 'Come with me.' I was surprised enough at this command that when he extended his hand I took it; after helping me out of the carrier, he led me to a small copse not far off, where he sat me down against a tree and began unstrapping his bundle, from whence he extracted a water flask and a small parcel of food. I was uninterested in refreshment and tried to refuse his offer, but he would not be denied, and after I'd dutifully taken a drink of sweet water and bitten into the corner of bread he tore off for me, he gave me a piece of dried fruit and bade me eat that too. All the while he smiled in encouragement, and something about his calm assuredness made me unable to resist his attempts to cheer me up. Indeed I did feel better almost immediately, and at last emerged sufficiently from my gloomy mood to thank him for his kindness. 'Please pardon if I presume, sir,' he said, 'but you are not unknown to me. The fact is, I have been following you: I wished to have a word, in order to convey my appreciation for your work.' I was astonished &mdash; though as I think now I might not have been, had my presence of mind not deserted me, for, once I looked him full in the face, he did indeed seem somewhat familiar. But at the time his declaration quite unnerved me, and I could not speak. 'I attended your address to the Convention, and found your topic fascinating. Do you mind if I ask you more about it?' Somehow I collected myself and responded that of course he could ask what he wished, but that I myself was no longer interested in the subject. I am afraid I was not very convincing in this prevarication &mdash; in fact it was an absurd thing for me to say &mdash; and he regarded me strangely for a moment, as if weighing what to do next. 'I take it...' he said, looking down and plucking gently at a patch of moss on the ground before him, '&mdash; forgive me if I am impertinent &mdash; I take it that the Council did not, perhaps, share my enthusiasm for your work?' At that moment I did not know what to do. The Council's ruling was explicit: I was forbidden to discuss the archive with anyone other than its members and its agents &mdash; and this man was, after all, a complete stranger to me. But perhaps the unexpectedness of the moment and his heartening demeanor made me less than cautious. He might easily have been an agent of the Council himself, sent to test my trustworthiness &mdash; and, truth be told, I cannot swear that he was not, though other interesting possibilities seem more plausible. Whatever the case, I admitted that the reception of my talk had not entirely matched my hopes, saying nothing of course about the Council's resolution, and asked that he interrogate me no further on the matter. The expression that dawned in his face, first of compassion, then of full comprehension &mdash; was most remarkable: I felt as if he had stood beside me throughout my entire inquisition, and suffered with me the same judgment. 'I will of course respect your wish,' he said quietly, acknowledging this with a bowed head, 'and ask no further questions. But, with your permission, I will tell you something of myself, so that you may judge the merit of my opinions.' I could think of no objection, and indeed my curiosity had at last been piqued by this odd encounter, so I invited him with a gesture to go on. 'Like you,' he said, 'I came to the Convention from a far place, where life seems simpler and not so treacherous as in that magnificent city &mdash; I for one am happy to be leaving it farther behind with each turn of our carrier's wheels. I too am a student of old things, though in my case it is artifacts, not texts, that I find of fascination. It could be said, of course, that a text is an artifact of a sort &mdash; I think you might agree with that proposition, would you not?' I nodded noncommittally. 'Ah! sorry! &mdash; I promised no question!' he said with a laugh. 'And in any case, I am not competent to argue the point very rigorously. I spend my life among old things, contemplating them, trying to discern their history, or rather, the story of their coming into my possession.' I could not help but interject that this was just like reading a text. 'Perhaps,' he said, delighted, 'but the difference is significant, I think. My task is simpler &mdash; but more difficult &mdash; than yours.' How so? I wished to know. 'The history that I seek to discern from one of my artifacts &mdash; insofar as it can be discerned! &mdash; is single. It cannot be transferred from one object to another. The artifact and its history are one. A text, on the other hand, exists in two places: first, it is bound to an object, an artifact &mdash; inscribed upon your tablet, for instance, or within the documents you displayed in your presentation &mdash; I'm so sorry! I'll not mention it again!' He appeared angry with himself, but I assured him that I hoped he would go on. The discussion we had entered was becoming quite enjoyable. 'A document is of course an artifact,' he continued, 'but the history of the object upon which the text is inscribed is only incidental, a matter of what materials are at hand with which to bind text and object together. The text itself is volatile &mdash; it may be inscribed directly from thought or copied from another document, for example, and can further be replicated and transferred to as many objects as one wishes.' But is not that process of replication and transferral part of the history of the text? 'No doubt,' he said, with a shrewd look, 'but the meaning of the text is not altered by the impress of that history, is it?' I could not stop myself from saying that the meaning of a text is always changed in its replication and transmission, because the meaning of a text is the combined understanding of the author of the text and its reader. 'I agree. Now you see what I mean about your task being easier but more complex than mine!' I had to laugh. I wasn't sure I accepted his premise that the history of an artifact is singular. And couldn't the history of the artifact be communicated from one person to another? 'Only by means of encoding that history into a text, which of course is then entirely transferrable. That is the nature and purpose of text.' But what other form can the history of an artifact take &mdash; once it is 'discerned' &mdash; than that of a text? He laughed again, holding up both hands. 'I am out of my depth,' he said, 'and cannot dispute with you. I confess that I am describing my feelings about the matter, rather than carefully working out an argument. It is why I have yet to make a presentation to the Conference &mdash; I could not hope to be taken seriously.' You cannot know that until you try, was my rejoinder. He straightened up somewhat and looked at me. 'This is &mdash; was &mdash; your first Convention, was it not?' And likely my last, I said with chagrin. 'You must not... take... their words to heart,' he said, as if in pain. 'They... know nothing... that matters. However that may be,' he went on, more easily, 'they could be wrong in rejecting your work &mdash; you did present material that was completely new to them, and, having no idea how to fit it into their scheme of things, they dismissed it as nonsense.' They did worse than that, I said, then shut my mouth. But he seemed once again to know exactly what I was thinking, what I was recalling with such shame. Only this time his expression of sympathy was mixed with anger. 'It was evil what they did to you,' he said, barely opening his mouth. 'But you will profit from it. Theirs is the true loss.' How did he know these things? He reached across and put his hand on mine. 'You are not without friends,' he said, looking earnestly into my eyes. 'The archive is lost &mdash; perhaps &mdash; but you are not.' With that he stood, and looked toward the bridge. 'It appears your guide has prevailed,' he said, and indeed the first of our wagons had begun to move again. He rebuckled his bundle and helped me up, and we walked to the carrier. But when we got there, he did not climb in after me. 'I have delivered my message,' he said, 'and must now follow another way. But do not forget me, or what I said at the last.' And with that he strode off in the direction from which he had come. Just then my carrier lurched forward, and I fell into my seat. By the time I regained my balance and turned around to look for him, he had disappeared.   As I pondered this peculiar encounter, more and more questions arose. Where was the man from? What did he mean when he said, 'I have delivered my message'? It seemed evident that some unknown person (or entity?) had sent him after me; what was not at all clear was why. 'You are not without friends,' he said. 'The archive is lost &mdash; perhaps &mdash; but you are not.' He spoke these words with a certainty, even a kind of authority, that was unmistakable. I began to wonder how this man knew so much about what was after all my confidential audience with the Council. Who were these friends he assured me I was 'not without'? As I reflected upon this question, I began to perceive the political potential of my attempt to introduce the archive into the discourse of the Conference. It took me quite some time to piece together an inference of what may have happened, but by and by a plausible interpretation took shape before me. The content and purport of the actual presentation I delivered at the Convention could well have been, as it were, immaterial. It was not unknown to me that there were factions within the Conference, and that the present Council was not entirely the impartial deliberative body its charter made it out to be: it comprised persons of differing opinions and experience, and, more to the point, divergent loyalties to various points of orthodoxy, each of which had its champions and detractors. The tension between these contending points of view was supposed to provide balance, which is a fine idea, but I began to suspect that it didn't work the way its framers intended &mdash; or not only that way. In the case of matter that fell outside the established parameters of doctrinal debate &mdash; such as the material that makes up the archive &mdash; the precedent has always been to submit a prospectus to the Council well in advance of the actual Convention, but I felt there wasn't time for me to do that. My plan, such as it was, woefully underestimated the complexity of the situation. That miscalculation was repaid handsomely, to be sure! When first confronted with the Council's decision not only to reject my conclusions, but to confiscate all my documents and forbid me to pursue this work further, I at first regarded Censure and Confiscation as a punitive measure, which, however harsh, was motivated not by malice or political considerations on their part, but by my not following the protocols, which were well known to me. I could not deny that my flouting of the rules was flagrant, but I had foolishly hoped that the excitement engendered by my discovery would militate against a literal application of the statutes. Having discovered I was wrong, I at first blamed my pride, and even accepted my humiliation as being in some way deserved &mdash; or in any event occasioned &mdash; by the arrogance that led me to misconceive to whom I was presenting what and how. But now I began to consider that perhaps the Council's actions had nothing to do with me, nor my revolutionary findings, nor even the irregular manner in which I brought my work before them. Maybe I was simply a pawn in some maneuver of which no one but the participants would have knowledge, of use only to check or countercheck some opponent's equally malevolent ploy. Naturally, I found this construal somewhat comforting. But it was pale consolation for my loss, and shortly a knot of anger formed in my chest that grew hotter by degrees as I brooded on the corruption of this scheme of things. How could anything fresh or creative in thought or research ever survive in such a poisonous atmosphere? This anger of course was stoked by the stranger's words, 'It was evil what they did to you,' and for a long while I fairly luxuriated in the feeling of self-righteousness that too often accompanies harsh treatment, justified or not. But eventually the sweetness of my rage began to cloy, and my heart told me this was not good enough. Fury would not carry me through the sorrowful task that awaited me at this journey's end, would indeed only deepen my misery, as there was nothing I could do to redress it. For the first time in my life, I began to feel keenly the truth of that old saying of the Remnant: Anger destroys everything. I looked out, and saw that the light was already softening into evening, and in the farthest distance I descried the beacon set on the mountaintop of my home. We would arrive by dusk. In the short time remaining before then, I returned to wondering about the stranger himself. The dialogue he set in motion was of keen interest to me, but as I recalled it, he put forth his proposition rather crudely, and just as we were getting to the heart of the matter he broke off, protesting his incompetence at debate. I had begun to look forward to the coming hours, during which we could indulge the scholar's delight in disputing. Not a scholar then, I concluded, or at any rate not a professional. A messenger from one, however, or from more than one. One of the factions in the Council? That seemed unlikely &mdash; 'You mustn't take their words to heart,' he said, 'They know nothing that matters.' This unquestionably took in everyone, not just members of an enemy bloc. What did he mean? That scholarship doesn't matter? Perhaps. But he was not simply dismissing the Council's words out of hand. He felt deeply, personally, the words he spoke. What they had done to me offended him &mdash; more, outraged him &mdash; so much so that he could not help but convey it to me. I may of course never know the particulars, but the truth of his anger was incontestable. However, this line of thought led back into the tiresome vortex of self-pity from which I wished to escape, and so I turned my attention to the stranger's disclosures about himself. He said that, like me, he came to the Convention from a far place, implying that he had done so more than once, perhaps on a regular basis. And yet, he also said, he himself had never addressed the Convention, but was apparently content merely to attend the exhibitions of others for his own edification. Or was he perhaps there to observe the proceedings for some other purpose? or the secret purpose of someone other than himself? My recent ratiocinations had cast a suspicious light on everything, I realized, not without amusement, and I again bethought myself of what the stranger had divulged about his own circumstances. He began our conversation by saying he spent his time with artifacts, as he called them, and I sensed this word had a special meaning for him. Objects with a story, he said &mdash; rather, a history &mdash; which he made it his undertaking to discover. Setting aside the issue we had taken on in our too-brief conversation on the topic &mdash; the relation of text to artifacts &mdash; I wondered what these objects might be: jewelry, clothing, tools, weapons, musical instruments? I was suddenly seized with curiosity about the stranger's artifacts, and the means he employed to extract &mdash; or discern, to use his terminology &mdash; their history. I could not imagine his methods except by analogy to the analytics I apply &mdash; or, rather, applied at one time &mdash; to the texts once in my care. And what form did this history take? He seemed to resist the notion that his process created a text; but if not a text, what did it create? And how was it communicated? Who benefitted? Himself alone? I began to feel a certain irritation toward my new acquaintance &mdash; or colleague, which he now surely was &mdash; for being so mysterious, almost deliberately obfuscatory, but at that moment our procession pulled to a stop at the gate of my settlement, and I realized how exhausted I was. I determined to think about nothing more until the morning. And with that I secured my luggage, returned to my room, and fell into a dreamless sleep.","1ScholarsConfessio.html"],
	["Scholar's Diary","... If this document is authentic, then a complete reappraisal will be necessary. Our idea of that era is based upon the fact that the only writings we possess are lists, fragments of what might be poetry, and mere descriptions of exotic objects belonging to now-lost inventories. A preliminary reading suggests that in fact writing &mdash; and dare I say? &mdash; thinking very like our own existed at that early date. If that is true, however, several questions arise, with which I will attempt to grapple in a moment. The document came into my possession via a source I cannot name. The document itself is a copy, made very recently, and so of course it may be a forgery, a fiction. I was skeptical myself until I read it, and still harbor serious doubts &mdash; or more precisely fears &mdash; about its authenticity. My immediate problem is this: should I present this document to the Conference? The reasons for not doing so are only too obvious. I cannot make any claim for the document's validity without naming my source, and then presenting that source's credentials for scrutiny. It would also be necessary to find solid corroboration for the facts set forth in the document. Unfortunately, the extant evidence &mdash; lists, inventories, etc. &mdash; has already been examined thoroughly, and its interpretation is considered more or less settled. All this adds up to a resounding 'Don't be a fool!' &mdash; exactly what my colleagues will consider me if I go ahead and present this astonishing find without backing up my assertions. Had I come into possession of the document a year ago, I might have been able to rearrange existing evidence or unearth new material (I think I know where to look). Now, of course, there is no time. All my experience with the Conference, in addition to my native caution, tells me to wait. To present now could easily ruin my career. The next gathering of the Conference is three years away. That would be, it seems to me, plenty of time to prepare a good case for the document's legitimacy. But for that very reason, I must consider that sooner or later some of my colleagues might hear about what I am doing, and leap into the chase. Should that happen, I fear that the faint track left so many generations ago would become obliterated by their trampling feet. I must be free to pursue this without interference, wherever it may lead. And I strongly feel that this discovery, if it can be substantiated, could make my reputation, not only among my colleagues, but for generations to come. It begins to seem that the prudent choice is not to be prudent. I believe that if I present now, I will be in effect (if not in fact) laughed out of the Conference. If my colleagues become convinced that I am a crackpot, they may leave me alone. However, I must not hedge the presentation, first of all in loyalty to my belief in the document, and second because it will place me on record at this earliest date. And actually, I cannot imagine any more effective way to guarantee my colleagues' incredulity than to make a straight case &mdash; nay, to do so enthusiastically. So I will present.","1ScholarsDiary.html"],

	["stars","Last night, feeling lost and desperate in my little attic room, I began to sing one of the hymns I learned as a young man in the city, a glorious anthem praising the deities one by one, which culminates in a rising chant joining our earthly voices to the choirs of immortals in a great burst of adoration for all the hosts of heaven. Well, it was just my voice alone, at the beginning and at the end, and if the deities were listening, they gave no sign, unless it was the dog I heard baying in a distant yard. My 'instrument' is much decayed, and I could not make it all the way through the longer phrases without gasping, but after a while I fell into the rhythm of breathing that the lines impose, and was able to attain all but the highest reaches of the melody without my voice cracking. This morning the stars are out, and although not all their patterns are familiar, I do recognize some constellations that I memorized as a boy, lying on my back in the field, those many nights when I could not sleep, repeating their magical names over and over. The sky behind the stars is deep blue-black, a rich cloth over which brilliant jewels were scattered by a careless hand &mdash; the hand, it may be, of a languid youth or maiden in love, or dreaming of it. Dear gods, I am that boy in the field again, or the young man just arrived in the city, drifting from one fantastic festa to another, as if all of life were like this, a dream just a little less glorious than the supernal metropolis conjured by that old hymn. My voice was pretty in those days, if not beautiful, but it was good enough to get me work, and friends, and adventure. I had some vague sense of the historical moment, just then and just there, but only enough to be able to debate energetically with others who knew no more than I. Being young, we had no sense of the pressure of the past, nor much ability to imagine the future beyond the next engagement. In my memory now, that time is a blur of brilliant colors, pierced by moments of fierce beauty, but these images are fragments without context, and it would be impossible to recreate any kind of sequence for them: I lived here, I lived there, loved this one then that one, sang this ditty or that psalm, but I cannot remember in what venue nor for what event. I recall great excitement, but not its occasion; deep sorrow, but not its cause. Most of all, I remember the color of the night: deep shadows looming over radiant streets, the velvety shimmer in the darkened room with only two people in it. Now the light is up, the sky is white, the stars are gone. I can see every ear of corn in the field on the hill across from me, and every mountain reflected in the lake beyond. A gaudy pink cloud trails like a long scarf from the neck of the tallest peak, and, in the near distance, one window gleams back at mine from the house beside the field. I cannot stay here, of course. But I will take this moment with me when I go.","1stars.html"],
	["Steadfast Bone-Snapper","My grandson the scriptor, the triumph and hope of our sorry little family, has asked me to supply him with the story of my life, now that I can no longer perform my official duties; to tell him how it was with us, as he puts it, but mostly, I believe, to make me account for myself: to explain to him how I could persevere for so many years in my abominable occupation and still consider myself a proper human being. Very well. The work of my life has always been double: to perform the duties imposed upon me by my masters so that no complaint could be lodged against me; and to redeem our family name, so that we should no longer suffer the ignoble reputation with which my profession is benightedly encumbered. I will not at this time burden my high-minded but nonetheless loving grandson with the ridiculous happenstance through which our clan was thrust from its humble but respectable position in society. But I will tell how it came to be that I, through hard work and impeccable conduct, gained sufficient respect, within our sometimes small-minded community, that it became possible for him to be given the opportunity for a better life. In fairness, I must say that he has prospered in his work through his own admirable behavior, and also that his unconscious attitude of superiority to me is forgivable: first of all, it is no more than what everyone else believes; and second, as I have said, he is a loving soul in spite of the arrogance that seems natural to persons of his age and early attainment. My father, who served as executioner, grave-digger, and night-watchman in the tiny town where I was born, was able, through his acquaintance with others of his trade, to help me win an apprenticeship, when I was sixteen years old, in the Office I served as Rectifier for over thirty years. Before that, I was employed as his assistant, learning the tools, the knots, and the holds, helping with the carpentry, and practicing with his second sword on stray dogs. It is not amiable work, but it is essential. As long as there is evil done in this world, it must be redressed, or it will spread without check. And someone must perform that preventive function, however distasteful the thought of it may be to the refined sensibilities of philosophers and artistes. As the Remnant say, there are laws in this world, and we live by them. At one time, that world formed a coherent, intelligible whole; evildoers simply could not prosper, since it was their actions, not what they pretended or avowed they were doing, that people believed. Now, it matters less what a person does, or even what others say they think about it, but by what name the deed comes to be known, and once a person's action is given a title, this name can give shelter to scoundrels, whose position (in a society more concerned with what things are called than with what is actually done) prohibits such creatures from being reached by justice. It has been my duty all these years to be the point of the sword of justice, but that sword is simply no longer long enough. In my youth, if men and women did their work, the society we formed with that work was whole and sound. Those who did not do their work languished, and were gradually sloughed off by the rest. A scriptor, like my grandson, was not required, because everyone knew everyone else, and what they had done, and what others said they had done, and what to make of what those others said, because we knew those others as well. No documentation was required. A scriptor's work interferes with this power of discernment in people to decide for themselves what is true and what is not, based on their experience of the particular circumstance, of the event itself, and of life in general. The scriptor's work &mdash; the creation of a text &mdash; permits a tyrant to proclaim, 'This is what took place, this is what was done, as it is here written. Whatever you believe to be the case, this is the truth.' You cannot argue with a text, for text has no ears to hear, no mind to judge, no heart to forgive. You may say that a person who was not right there, when this or that happened or was done, cannot know the truth concerning the event or deed, but must rely on a second-hand account from someone who was. Yes, but if I know the person giving the account, and if I am attentive to how that person tells the tale, I will know what that person believes to be true, always remembering that a person can be wrong. But you cannot lie to a person's face without betraying this fact, and liars only get away with their crimes when their listeners are either distracted by their own desires or complicit in the crimes themselves, oftentimes both. You may object that some liars are so good at their craft that they can fool anyone. Not so: the first thing I heard in my mother's womb may have been her beating heart, but the second thing I heard was her voice. When I emerged from that wonderful place into this terrifying domain, the first thing I saw was the face of the midwife, a stranger. I have spent every day of my life since then reading faces and interpreting their utterance; and if I have not learned by now how to do that properly, whoever tricks me with a lie is entitled to whatever reward can be wrung from it.","1SteadfastBone-Snapper.html"],

One feels safe, if only for the moment: the chase, the flight, the incessant clashing or brandishing of weapons, fighting one's way through the pack of others fighting their way, or else biding one's time with impatience, reading the signs, tasting the wind, parsing the clouds &mdash; all done with, as if long ago. Few come here; fewer still return to the land where all men are. Once brought here, one understands why. In the land where all men are, it is nearly impossible to conceive that there even is such a place as the land where no man is, let alone find it. Nearly. And nearly is near enough for most, for they have other things to do &mdash; for other men, to other men, with other men, in the world they have builded together. Of the very very few for whom the word 'impossible' is not a comfort but a summons, very very few ever find the land where no man is, for they do not know how to look for such a place: all their maps and their diagrams, their tools and their engines, their lessons and their practices, were devised to be deployed in the land where all men are, and none are any use in the land where no man is. There is no Teacher here, no Teaching to be brought back from here. This is not the wilderness, in its many kinds, of which the world is but one. To seek this place, one must set off in the opposite direction from all worlds. To approach the land where no man is, one must abandon every thing in the world, and this cannot be done without violence.

	["The Locust Grove","We were lolling in the grove of honey locusts that stand on the terrace just outside the main hall, above the esplanade at the water's edge. It was hot, and we were sweating in our regalia &mdash; the closing ceremonies of the Convention were to begin in an hour's time &mdash; and we'd taken wine at luncheon, during which some venerable luminary had been lauded for a lifetime's contribution to the community. I was sitting on a bench, my back against one of the graceful trees that shaded us from the blazing sun, enveloping us in the golden glow of their just yellowing leaves. The tower bell tolled in pairs, blessing the lazy murmur of desultory discourse, attended by the gardeners laboring invisibly nearby, waiting for us to move, and the bees that worked the sea-roses in their beds beside the cove. There was a remarkably high chop, and the pleasure craft tied up there strained at their moorings, thumping against the pier posts and each other in a vaguely annoying way. Otherwise, all was well, all was very well, and the tranquility of the scene was enlivened by the bouncing bosoms of young women taking exercise along the esplanade, a pleasant spectacle that we scholars affected to eye with disdain, while the gardeners' young assistants gazed at them with frank admiration and desire. Two of us were discussing the life shared by those august persons who had occupied the dais at the luncheon we were at present digesting &mdash; figures from all over the world whose accomplishment had earned them the right to move confidently among the highest levels of society. One of my colleagues, reflecting the clear expectation we all had that we would follow these important people into a life of attainment, wondered if they might feel more at ease in each other's company than they would with folk from their place of origin, even their own families. The other said this was certainly true, and proposed that this commonality might even extend to their sense of possibility, of knowing with assurance what could be changed or created in this world, and of themselves as possessors of the knowledge, skills, and power to make it so. We fell silent, nodding &mdash; what more need be said? A breeze passed politely through the grove, cooling my forehead; a robin warbled sweetly in the branches high above the grove. An odd phrase drifted through my mind: my fugitive peace. Just then a disturbance erupted near the side door where the workmen and servants came and went: a man in scholar's garb, ill-fitting and faded, staggered out into the plaza. After righting himself, he began to move towards us with the overcareful precision of a person who's had too much to drink, trying with difficulty to keep his eyes focused on the path. Suddenly he began to shake, and stumbled down the steps to the railing, where he vomited copiously into the pristine blue water. It was shock as much as anything, I believe, that made us laugh at the drunken man, but our amusement turned to disgust as he roared again and again, bending strenuously over the rail with each heave, until long past the point where there was anything more to bring forth. All the charming music of the moment before had ceased &mdash; except for the thudding of the boats &mdash; and every scholar, resident, servant, and wild creature in the cove stared at the man as he eventually straightened up and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. He turned and attempted to smooth his tunic, which only made worse the slashing stain down its front. Then he raised his eyes and met mine. We were no more than a few paces apart, and the look on his face has haunted me my whole life. I saw him see me, and know me, and somehow try to tell me with those baleful eyes that what had happened to him could happen to me, that the worst thing I could ever imagine was ever waiting, always able to come to pass, and that there is nothing whatever in this magnificent world that can protect anyone from that. He regarded each of the rest briefly, then took in a sharp breath through his nose and strode straight through our little group, scattering those in his path, making for the main gate, through which he then passed without hesitating and was gone. Immediately my colleagues began to cluck and comment excitedly. One recognized him from a pre-convention workshop some days before, something about an archive of ancient writings that he had discovered in a backwater House upriver somewhere. Another had heard an administrator remark that the Council would make short work of the 'country cousin with the archive' &mdash; obviously an upstart trying to push his way in among his betters by passing off forged documents as a major find in his province. During the interminable speeches and ceremonies of self-congratulation that followed, I idly wondered how such a pageant would appeal to the poor inebriate we had seen in the locust grove. If any of the gossip about him was true, he might have deserved whatever punishment he received; but I mused that deserving my punishment has never made it any easier to take, and, were I in his place, I most certainly would seize my first opportunity to get so crapulent I puked my insides out all over the authorities' pretty little cove. Before this, it would never have occurred to me that said authorities could be totally in the wrong, but the aftermath of the wine, the stifling heat of the auditorium, and the pompous thunderings of the speakers' perorations had cast me into a misanthropic mood, and for the first time I began to reflect rather darkly upon the enterprise to which my guardians had engaged me.","1TheLocustGrove.html"],

Now I stand in the garden in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, not wishing to sleep, wanting only to soak in the moon's cool light, as it sinks into me like the touch of my beloved's hands, breathes in me, shivering me, all certainty shattered, falling all around, like standing stalks when the band is cut.

	["The Perpetrated World","What do I mean by 'The Perpetrated World'? I mean what we once called the Real World: the domain of business & commerce; of politics & government; of teaching, learning, and especially of scholarship &mdash; that is, teaching & learning in schools, scholarship in the service of making more books, articles, and slideshows for conventions. I mean the World of Text. Every one of these enterprises, and the institutions that embody them, is based in text, mediated by text, trafficked through text, backed up by text, created, extended, maintained, and enforced by text &mdash; in fact, entirely made up of text. And text, as we know, is a perpetration &mdash; our experience of life rolled up & jammed into little suitcases made of words so they can be transported away from us poor gobbets of meat stuck forever in the Here&Now, without our permission, to anywhere the ghosts need them to be, for purposes beyond our ken. Worse, our guardians contaminate us with their ghosts from the moment we're born, setting up a chatter that never ceases, so that by the time we learn to talk ourselves we're making up our own ghosts, and end up believing our whole lives long that what the ghosts say is what we are, that what they make us do is our own idea &mdash; until it's impossible to even see that what the ghosts want could possibly be different from what we want, or that it could be bad for us to go along with their nefarious plots. And it is bad for us, and for everything we come in contact with, which we have to rip out & dig up & kill off & move somewhere else to make room for what the ghosts call Our (meaning Their) Magnificent Creations, which are in truth monstrosities of ruination &mdash; huge, hideous, dead constructions in which the only life forms left (us) scurry to & fro in the blinding light, bearing more 'creations' for the ghosts from one place to another, & generating more and more text, whose artifacts spawn like pond scum throughout the whole system, piling up to fill every erstwhile empty scintilla of space. Well, not any more. The ghosts overwhelmed us, the so-called 'system' went chaotic, and then the whole world &mdash; text, meat, ghosts, everything &mdash; just... blew up. What was lost when the ghosts got their way and destroyed everything? Nothing of value, as far as I can tell. I'm living in the smoking crater of their senseless self-immolation along with that brave, beat-up but unbroken little boy, who knows better than to speak to me, keeping his ghosts to himself if he has any. And so far, I miss nothing of that Perpetrated World, and feel nothing but relief that it's gone. That boy's silent company is more consolation to me than a million million texts could ever ever be. And our brief friendship has given me the courage and the cussedness to keep fighting off what's left of my ghosts until I am at last brought down by the noble failure of the meat. Point is, nothing important happened, when whatever hit us hit us. I don't know what it was, and I find I don't care what it was. Suddenly one day nothing worked, and then everyone else disappeared. For a short while, it was a scramble to figure out how to manage, but that turned out to be no different from the way it was before, except that I no longer had to consult the ghosts, who were always squabbling with each other about what to do next! The peace that engenders is beyond price.","1ThePerpetratedWorld.html"],
	["The scriptor and his beloved","One of my fellow scriptores startled me this morning by asking why I do what I do. I first thought he meant the tasks my master sets me, but that is what we all do: obey our masters' commands &mdash; no other reason need be asked. As he continued to look at me, however, I could see that he meant something else, and immediately feared that he had somehow discovered my secret work here in the archives. I responded by looking puzzled, at which he replied, 'No, of course we all perform the work our masters command, but you seem to enjoy your labors. What pleasure can you get out of all that copying, notating, linking? It's intolerably boring; worse, it's trivial. Who will ever read any of it? And our masters themselves are slaves to the same pointless donkey work. All we learn from them is how to waste our lives!' We all laughed at the truth of this, but also because the fellow in question is newly in love, and therefore belittles any exertion that keeps him from his beloved. The rest began to tease him on this account, which he endured as best he could. But the question made me think: not why do I do what I do, but what am I really doing? What is it about the unquestionable drudgery of my work that yet gives me such joy in it? The answer, I came to see, lies in the devotion that impels both me and my amorous colleague to bear, even to treasure our longsuffering for the sake of what we love &mdash; or rather, whom we love. I know not what humble gifts my friend fashions for the object of his devotion, but in my case, every word I copy or passage I notate or link to its distant cousin in another writing is a gift I prepare for *my* beloved, the reader who someday may pick up this old writing and become absorbed in it. I want that person, unknown to me in every other way, to share my excitement; I want to give that person the liveliest pleasure &mdash; to be ravished by something bright and right and beautiful for the first time.","1Thescriptorandhisbeloved.html"],
	//["The Starling","When she was young, the Starling was given charge of a stranger who became lost in the mountains where her people lived. While gathering mushrooms in the forest, she heard the piteous cries of a wounded animal. Thinking that her brothers and uncles would be pleased with her if she helped them bring home good meat &mdash; and might even one day let her go hunting with them &mdash; she followed the sound to discover what animal it might be. By and by she came to the brink of a deep ravine, and there, down at its murky bottom, lying partway in the stream, she perceived the form of the largest man-creature she had ever seen. The hair on his head was the shade of birch leaves in autumn, and his strange clothing, once brightly colored, was torn and filthy from much wear in the weather. He lay on his back, with one leg bent out in a way that a leg does not bend without breaking. Studying the marks of his trail in the earth, she quickly perceived what happened: while climbing down the opposite bank, the creature lost his footing and started to slide, and so tried to leap across to a ledge on her side of the ravine. But the ledge was too narrow and he hit it too low, and, after hanging for some time by the fingers of one hand, he lost his hold and fell like a spinning leaf to the bottom. His voice was weakening; it was late in the day; he would certainly be dead before morning. The Starling pondered what to do. At last she descended to the ledge from which the creature had fallen, tore a square from the corner of her apron, and placed a handful of mushrooms within it. Then she measured and cut a length of her line, one end of which she fastened to a sturdy root projecting from the bank. At the other end, she tied up the mushrooms in a bundle, and lowered it over the ledge until it hung just within the creature's reach. Believing it best not to be seen, she climbed back up to the top of the bank, and, hiding behind the trunk of a mighty oak, gave a cry as of a great bird of prey. Then she ran away.","1TheStarling.html"],
	["this road","Yesterday one of my resources failed, maybe fatally, and I cannot discover what went wrong. I really can't deal with a major cock-up just now, but unless I do some investigating, I won't know whether to reconstitute the resource (if I can), work around it for the moment, or go without. I've automated a diagnostic that will crawl the whole system and give me some hard figures I can maybe work with, but that will take a day or so to run, and in the meantime I've just lost the equivalent of an arm or a leg, certainly the use of more than one finger. At least I don't have a supervisor breathing on my cowlick, like in the old days. On the other hand, it also means I have no one to turn to if I get stuck. Like now. Well, can't be helped. We proceed on the basis of not enough facts, not enough time, and not enough stuff to work with, son &mdash; as my last boss liked to say, and always with a smirk &mdash; love to get my hands on his throat right now. No trouble deciding what to do in that situation! Here's what matters. Everybody working on this stuff thinks it's one thing, but I know it's not that thing, it's something else. They see what I'm doing, and they say, in effect (though never quite to my face), 'Why would anybody want to do that?' And maybe they're right &mdash; I mean about doing things their way: it works fine, their way, gets some results, some are even interesting. But if any of them asks what I'm doing and I tell them, they get that too-interested note in their voice and they say, 'Really? Fascinating.' And if I have to ask for help! even if I can get them to understand what I want to do, they say, 'Really? Why don't you just (fill in the blank with the first thing any moron would think of)?' and that's as far as that conversation ever gets. I hear that 'Really?' and I really want to kill. Anyway, I don't feel like I have time to keep carping about this &mdash; but then I can't do anything until the diagnostic's run its course. It's a weird place to be. On the one hand, I'm stupefied that they can't see what I'm saying, but on the other hand, if I'm wrong (which I'm not), then I can totally see why they're mystified by my being so stubborn (and occasionally shirty). That is, if things really work the way they think they do (which they don't), then I'm an idiot or a lunatic to keep doing things my way. (Or a poseur &mdash; I know some of them decided that long ago.) And it's not like this isn't an urgent matter. I mean, if they're right (which they're not), then we can all go on doing things their way and things'll be fine just the way they are &mdash; except they'll keep getting better and better! Isn't that what we all want (I hear them asking me, a tinge of annoyance creeping into their little voice)? Meanwhile they're thinking, What's the matter with you, freak? But if I'm right (and I am), things will not be fine just the way they are, and will not keep getting better and better, but worse and worse, until everything falls apart and our grandchildren are living in caves, if they're living at all. Of course I can't say that in front of Certain People, but that doesn't make me wrong. And so it's sometimes hard for me to keep my temper: everybody does things the way they do things only because that's the way everybody does things. Not to get all fussy and pedantic, but that's STUPID...   Diagnostic's done: news is bad. Either my little corner of the world is special (possible; not likely, though) or everybody's having the same problem, or will, very soon. Trouble is, I can't find out (from where I am at this point) which condition is the case. And I can't travel, not with all this gear. And where would I go? I have a backup plan, of a sort, but I don't trust it, and I can't test it: I can only switch over to it, after which the present system (which still works &mdash; sort of) will no longer function. I need to think this through, but there's no time: if I'm going to make the swap, it has to be now &mdash; tomorrow at the latest. I think I see how this will come down, either way, but either way I'm guessing. Just don't say to me, Only one way to find out! &mdash; if you want to keep your teeth.   I remember a poem just now that makes me wish I believed in the deities, just so I could say to them, Bless the person who thought of this: I always knew that one day I would take this road but yesterday I did not know that it would be today. It's the only thing that keeps me going. Puts everything in perspective. Reminds me of the world I'm really living in. Yes. Really.","1thisroad.html"],

	["a dream of the Great City","I was in the Great City; all my companions were familiar with the place, knew where to go and what to do, but I had never come here, and at first just stood where I found myself, gazing about in wonder: for over the whole scene a spirit of adventure seemed to preside, and with elation if anything I followed the dream where it led me. I was soon joined by a young woman who undertook to be my guide. As the young will sometimes do, she adopted a jocular didactic and over-patient manner towards me, and treated me like a not very bright student who needed to be catechized constantly, making me recapitulate every lesson I was learning under her tutelage. She also required me to describe clearly what I was seeing, and to say what I thought it meant, then rebuked me with sharp questions if she thought I was paying insufficient regard to her instruction. We both found this quite diverting, and our friendship warmed. Our way was crowded and very noisy: powerful music played all around us regardless of where we went. Most remarkable, the streets outside, and the floors within buildings that we entered, all crawled with what looked to be huge insects and many-legged worm-like creatures the size of cats or dogs &mdash; but they were all mechanical, made of filaments of the airiest gleaming metal or spun glass, streaming across the walls and ceilings as well as the tiles and pavements, twining the legs of tables and chairs, sliding swiftly about our feet, and occasionally climbing a short way up our bodies in a delicate exploratory fashion. But no one paid them any mind, and I felt no fear or revulsion &mdash; their touch was gentle, like being brushed by a bird's wing. Our group swelled and shrank as we made our way: at times my guide and I were members of a team working on a project, such as fitting together a structure or device whose purpose we did not know, and then, when it was completed, going separate ways to further tasks or explorations. At other times we stood together in a multitude, observing a performance or some kind of rite in the distance, which was reduplicated in huge mirrors on either side of the platform &mdash; these mirrors reflected and greatly magnified the image and voices of the performers or celebrants, so that we could hear them whisper and detect the subtlest emotions pass across their faces. Only once, or rather more than once in the same place, I was alone. The first time it seemed as if my companion had directed me there, or had sent me off to explore on my own and this is where I fetched up; at a later time, preceding her down a corridor, I opened a door and recognized the place from a previous visit, and said, 'The scene of the crime,' as if in jest, which she then repeated, looking over my shoulder, and in a pointed way, as if in confirmation, 'The scene of the crime.' The place was a tiny, cramped room, not much bigger than a storage closet, on an upper balcony overlooking the street or a large atrium &mdash; it was impossible to tell from our angle of approach. Inside it was equipped like an old-fashioned scriptorium, in the center of which stood a steeply slanted writing desk. Some kind of volume was under preparation upon its surface: the page being worked was inscribed only about halfway down; this page was topmost in a stack about as thick as the end joint of my thumb; another sheaf of pages was fastened to its upper edge, and hung upside-down over the back of the raked inscriptorius; these pages were covered with writings and drawings on both sides, as best I could see from just outside the door. The walls were fitted with shelves all the way from the floor to the ceiling, except for a casement just opposite the desk, where a pebbled-glass window let in hazy light; the shelves were piled &mdash; crammed, really &mdash; with papers, bottles, sacks, hand tools, and books on end; the narrow aisle between the desk and these shelves was further constricted at the corners by binding and cutting devices that stood about chest high. Suspended over the desk was a low chandelier which provided the flickering smoky light of three candle stubs. I don't remember seeing anyone in this room &mdash; indeed, it could hardly accommodate more than one person at a time &mdash; and I cannot tell how many times I returned thither, only that the last time, when I pushed open the door, it stuck, as I was suddenly reminded it always did, and at that I recognized the room, which prompted me to say, in the bantering manner my guide and I had fallen into, 'The scene of the crime,' and I recalled quite clearly all those details of the room's contents I just listed, and so concluded that I had been there before, even though I had no actual memory of walking around inside &mdash; that is, there was no event to which to tie the recollection, so that I could say, 'Ah, this is where that happened!' But, of course, as soon as I said, 'The scene of the crime,' and my companion repeated, in her mock-solemn way, 'The scene of the crime,' I was provided with the very event that permits me now to remember that scene in my dream, and perhaps the whole dream itself. I have often had the sensation, when absorbed in this or that writing in the archive, that I actually lived at the time it describes, in that place, among those people. Others have told of having the same feeling, and this mental phenomenon is often ascribed to the vividness of the writing that gives rise to it. It is true of course that bad writing, with its distracting errors, worn-out phrases, imprecisions, and mishaps of expression, can rarely if ever invoke this sense of utter familiarity. But it is also the case that truly brilliant writing can be distracting in much the same way, calling attention to itself and away from what it is attempting to convey &mdash; or rather, as it is a beautiful thing in itself, we gaze at it rather than the scene for which it is but the messenger, like an angel whose glory is so dazzling that we cannot comprehend the message it has come to deliver. No, this feeling of recollection comes from within; it is not called forth by some external stimulus, or not only by that, but by an inner need &mdash; and this need is fulfilled, however briefly and imperfectly, when it meets another's inner need to speak, to tell how it is with them, and with those from whom they came, or were sent. It is the need that is utterly familiar, and that meeting is like the one described by those who say that falling in love is not discovering the love of their life but recognizing the person they have always been in love with. Even if &mdash; need it be said? &mdash; they have never met before.","adreamoftheGreatCity.html"],

	["Afterword: Transmission of the Archives","So far as can be discovered, the 'hidden story' of the transmission of the Writings in the Archives has never been told all in one place. Herebelow, the present Curator will attempt to sketch in that much of the 'text' of the archives' history about which there is some certainty. The Archives originated in the holdings (if this is the proper term) of the Author who calls himself the Last One, and whose work dates from the liminal period that spans the collapse of the civilization of the Ancients and its aftermath. In several of his Writings, he describes a Boy who kept him company in his final days, and it can only be presumed that it was this Boy who gathered these texts and passed them on (along with at least two of his own writings) through an unknown number of intermediaries, to the first true curator of the Archives, Egderus Scriptor. Without question, it was Egderus who collected the Writings that form the core of the Archives, and, with the assistance of his young secretary (and successor as Curator) Markito, put them into the form of an anthology, so that they could then be transmitted as a whole. There followed a dark period of many generations, after which, in a process that continues to resist definitive description, the Archives came into the possession of an unnamed Scholar, who attempted to find them a home in the confraternity of learning of which he was, at that point, but a very marginal member. This endeavor failed (ruinously, for the Scholar) and the Archives were nearly lost when they were confiscated and the Scholar was banished from the community in which he had so hoped to win a place of distinction &mdash; not only for himself, but for the Archives and their story. However, in a weird, almost whimsical turn of events, a young person who had been a student at the time of the Scholar's obloquy later became the savior of the very documents that had destroyed him. This rescuer is by custom denominated with the setting of their brief accidental meeting, the Locust Grove adjoining the Temple of learning where the Scholar gave his presentation. We learn from the extensive Writings of this so-called Locust Grove Author that the Temple was itself destroyed in some kind of catastrophe &mdash; perhaps an earthquake or an act of war &mdash; that decimated the sodality of scholarship of which it was the spiritual as well as corporeal heart. After the Archives left the possession of the Locust Grove Author, another gap intervenes in our knowledge of what happened to them; we can, however, infer some of their story from the form in which they exist today. At some point, a later curator annotated certain passages in the Writings; this person has been called the Scholiast since the earliest discourse on the Archives, and ultimately the Scholia as a whole came to be regarded as a Writing in itself. Whether the Scholiast also supplied the INVENTORY of Authors and their Writings is a matter as yet unsettled, but there is no doubt that this first finding aid is also of venerable age, and certainly much predates the collection of Legomena (elucidations) that came to serve as its adjunct. These helpful ancillaria may well be the last 'original' Writings to be added to the archives prior to their being taken up by Bill Bly &mdash; the only other Curator since the time of Egderus who can be said to have a 'real' name.","AfterwordTransmissionoftheArchives.html"],

	["archive under threat","As with Egderus, I start this hidden writing in secret, since it is unlikely to be found among so much foliage from other trees. I have no hope of escaping detection much longer, since my master has started asking me about the archive &mdash; is it safe, he wants to know. So far I've been able to reassure him, but the last time I may have overplayed my attempt at breezy reassurance. A flicker in his eye, a tensing of the brow &mdash; it may be nothing; he is so anxious about other things &mdash; but if I am right, the next time he comes he will ask to see what I am working on. I need a decoy, something I have yet to put my mind to... I know he loves me and, in his hapless way, wants the best for me. But he is under compulsion himself, and I surmise it regards the archive, perhaps only as part of a larger concern among his superiors, who themselves may be under pressure from their own masters. I cannot fathom what that concern might be, but I do know that I am the one least likely to survive any major upheaval. Indeed, I may be sacrificed early in order to stave off just such a disruption, and I imagine my master, whom I know so well, is terribly worried about the same thing &mdash; if not for my sake, then for his own: dear man that he is, he is too weak to be able to protect these writings from the very people indicted herein. Enough preamble. I have been making a copy of every writing in the archive, and until now supplying each with as much as I could deduce about its author, the intention in writing it, and the circumstances under which it was produced. This is very toilsome, of course, and a great deal of this adminicular labor requires guessing, at which I am a poor practitioner. The resulting documentum is becoming unwieldy, both in its ideational complexity and its physical cumbersomeness: notae must be inserted into the text of my copy (in a different script, to signify that they are notae) or, in the case of an afterthought, attached by means of some device to the writing itself. Should I have to leave in haste, I can only dump everything pell-mell into a not very commodious bag I have reserved for the purpose. Nonetheless, the work proceeds, though the pace has necessarily slowed since I arrived at the commentary supplied by one of my predecessors, because I now must deal not only with the writing as a Writing, but also with the annotation system, which I must say is not entirely systematic. But then my predecessor too was operating in stressful conditions &mdash; though it seems that at first it was the stress of joyful excitement at making this discovery under the very noses of the wise men of the time. However, I anticipate &mdash; it is easy to be drawn off the path into the enchantment of a particular story, and the archive is rich in such temptations. My plan is to finish copying the primary Writings and then find a safe place to hide them &mdash; in fact, I think I may transfer the Writings I have already finished, in case [Fragment ends here &mdash; Ed.]","archiveunderthreat.html"],
	["Aric: Aftermath","My Dear Friend Egderus: As you know, Little Brother, I do not write well, but I have become powerful enough to command my own scriptor, after the fashion of the Good Doctor, whom you and I helped to his reward. He's not as pretty as you &mdash; my scriptor, I mean &mdash; but he writes a clean hand, which I can make out enough to keep him from tricking me, and he knows I am forced to put my trust in him. For such people &mdash; you are one &mdash; the temptation to be good is irresistible. I am glad to be able to steal some moments each night from the business of my master the Golias to tell a few tales, as in the good old days at Mountain House. I'm not sure the Golias would be pleased with this story, or with parts of it, and that is why this message will not be sent to you until after I am dead. That will be the task of my little scriptor here, and may he be roasted on a spit over a slow fire if he fails his assignment. To begin with the last moments of our friendship, the night of the Historian's escape. While you and your sweetie were sneaking off to the woods, my master Robenc confronted the Good Doctor at his lodging. You may guess who was charged with guarding the door. Naturally, it became noisy &mdash; I told Robenc it would have been better to lure him to a more secret spot, but my master was convinced his cause was just, and this would somehow protect him from interference. I took what precautions I could ahead of time, but I knew it was likely I'd have to do something drastic if we were discovered. This is exactly what happened. The Good Doctor triggered some kind of alarm, and within a few minutes I could hear a squad of stratioti pounding down the street. I'd foreseen something like this, and so I waited around the corner until they were nearly upon me, then leaped out in front of the centurion and jammed my short sword into the notch of his throat, with enough force that his head fairly came off when he slammed onto his back in front of the rest. My attack was so swift and sudden they were frozen in mid-canter. There were half a dozen of them. Young 'uns, of course, with long legs and healthy lungs &mdash; I'd never get away from them. Little Brother, it was the moment of my life: every person must face it, no one knows when it will come, no one knows what they will do when it jumps up in front of their face like that. As it happened, I did the only thing that could have saved my sagging hide. I started yelling at them, like my old sergeant in boot camp. I chewed them up the front, and raked them down the back. Some of them I knew, and picked on them the worst. I laid into them so hard, so loud, and so vicious, that in a minute's time they were pleading with me not to turn them in. Not a one of them but thought I'd heard the noise and come running too, and killed that damned green centurion by accident and their negligence. Fortunately, the uproar inside was still going on, so I bullied them back into formation, and made them charge the door and bash it in. They were right there, in the front hall. Robenc had the Good Doctor by the throat, but the Good Doctor had a knife, and he'd already slashed Robenc's arms and face pretty bad with it. If we hadn't busted in and pried them apart, Robenc would have had the Good Doctor strangled, but then he'd have bled to death himself. I don't think he cared. When he finally looked at me, his eyes were shining. He'd done what he went there to do. He'd brought his great enemy under his hand, and taught him terror. Lucky for me, he spoke not a word. Not then, nor ever again that I know of. Believe it or not, this was the first time I'd ever seen the Good Doctor up close, and in that moment he wasn't exactly an imposing person. In the first place, his bowels had betrayed him, and he stank something awful. He was in his night-dress, all torn and stained, and I'd thought he had more hair on his head. I almost laughed, he looked so bedraggled and pathetic, but the boys' nostrils were flaring from the stench of battle, and I was hardly safe yet. Before the Good Doctor could get his breath, I had them both arrested until this breach of the peace could be explained. I made sure the boys understood they were not to permit either man to speak. The Good Doctor kept trying to protest, but he soon figured out it was pointless to struggle against our kind of stupidity. I could see him casting about in his mind for a way out, but I was determined to hem him in completely before he could find it. I had the two strongest and stupidest boys make him their especial care, and sent them into another room to wait for me to question him. The rest I gave charge over Robenc, who was smiling to himself now, and would not even look at me when I addressed him. I told them to take the Praetor back to his quarters, where I would speak to him later. I was hoping that once there my master Robenc would come to his senses and make up some plausible story to get them to release him. The Good Doctor was my concern now. Once he began to talk in the hearing of people who knew who he was, he would be able to slither through my fingers, so I simply had the gorillas haul him off to the Keep until I could report to the Golias and get further instructions. And that I did. At the time I didn't know if you'd been able to get your boyfriend fairly away, but there was no way for me to help you if you hadn't. All I could do was make the ruckus as confusing as I possibly could. First I ran to the palace and charged right in, shouting that the Golias was about to be assassinated. This got me into his presence pretty quick. Once he realized who I was &mdash; that is, who I was coming from &mdash; he dismissed his personal guard and made me tell him the whole story. 'Did this Historian actually escape?' 'That I don't know, sir. Praetor Robenc did not tell me how that part of the plan was to work.' This of course was a lie, but if there was any chance of keeping you out of it, Little Brother, I wanted to do just that. I found it interesting that the Golias asked me nothing more about Robenc, but only about the Good Doctor: where had I taken him, had anybody seen us, did any of the stratioti guarding him know who he was, and the like. I gathered from these questions that the Golias was not exactly displeased that the Good Doctor was in this position. Did he know that hateful man, and wish him ill the same as you and Robenc did? That was not my impression. My impression was that the Golias saw this situation as some kind of opportunity, and he was making sure he understood everything about it in order to secure his next move, whatever that might be. And in that moment terror finally touched me, and I saw what real danger my master Robenc had led me into. I perceived that if the Golias ever did come to understand everything about this situation, I was a piece of meat. He appreciated me now, for bringing him this news, but that's all I was to him &mdash; a messenger. I had to make him need me. I told him that the Good Doctor had hinted at a conspiracy that even his own removal would not hinder, had even uttered threats against the person of the Golias himself. I could not play stupid with the Golias, but I could play ignorant. However, from the Golias' standpoint, not knowing what I didn't know of his designs was enough to keep him from getting rid of me. And so he accepted my suggestion that the Good Doctor be kept under arrest for the time being, in order to find out more about this suspected treason against him. You will be pleased to know, Little Brother, that the Good Doctor's last days with us were extremely uncomfortable, and, insofar as I could manage it, humiliating. He was never tortured, but I would not permit him to change his clothes nor to bathe, so that he might dwell at length in the odor of his own fear. Had it been earlier in the year, he certainly would have frozen to death in the unheated Keep, but as you may remember it was spring, and he only took a chill for a week or so. I had him moved from cell to cell so that he would have no chance to become familiar with his surroundings, and I questioned him every day, though never at the same time, and since we were below ground it was always dark, so he soon lost his sense of time. I am sure you would have known well how to interrogate such a man, but all I wanted to do was to buy you time, and so I simply asked him every question I could think of about this imaginary plot against the Golias, until we both began to believe it was real, in a way. But after many days of this, his spirit gave out, and he became almost peaceful. His countenance took on an expression that looked not that different from the one on Robenc's face that night when I pried his fingers off the Good Doctor's throat. The Good Doctor had been thin to begin with, as you know, but now his skin took on a kind of glow, his hair and beard turned white, and his voice became so soft that I'd have to put my ear to his lips in order to hear what he was saying. And of course what he was saying was nonsense, because everything we had ever said to each other was nonsense. It was a very disturbing experience. I never saw Robenc after that night at the Good Doctor's lodging. I discovered that after my boys had returned him to his quarters, a detail from the Golias himself appeared and summoned him to the palace. He never returned. I myself was named his successor, and as Praetor I not only had entirely too much to do in those early months, I felt strongly that it would be unwise to poke into the fate of the man I was fortunate enough to replace. By the time I had more or less stabilized my position, Robenc had disappeared. I still do not know what happened to him. At last we come to you, Little Brother. Surely you understand that they'd have never let you go, if for one second they saw how smart, how brave, how good you really are? seen you like I do, or did then? I had to ridicule you, humiliate you, disgrace you before them like that: the little scriptor who fell in love with his master's prisoner. It was the only way to divide the two events &mdash; there were too many coincidences otherwise. And I must say you played your part brilliantly. How you wept! At least I hope you were playing a part. It's the only way I can live with the shame that I brought upon myself, not you, by treating you that way. If my own little scriptor is as faithful to me as you were to your Historian, this letter will be the announcement of my death. Please know that, to my last breath, I have admired you, loved you, wished you well. Goodbye, Little Brother. Aric","AricAftermath.html"],

	["attack","Explosions everywhere, down near the square and up here on the plateau, some very close. Fog, or smoke, covers the hillside opposite, moving in. A flash in the mist, a sickening pause, then the sharp blow of the blast, its echo crackling around the unseeable lake. Roosters scream, and dogs can't stop yapping, but I hear no bells, no wheels on the cobblestones, no sound of people anywhere. Nothing moves except the fog, which roils, as a last cat sprints out of it, along a roof-ridge, and back in. I need to run, but cannot turn away from the window. I'm watching the world end. =====[lacuna]=====   ... on the mountaintop, in the woods. Further up, above the treeline, wind so fierce they were swept off the precipice &mdash; we watched them fall; their screams only reached us after they were out of sight. No one has spoken, no one can speak. I know we are safe here, for the moment, but no one else does. These are gentle folk, happy folk, they cannot take in what just happened &mdash; not that I could explain, even if I spoke their language. I don't know what they'll do next, once they catch their breath, but if they decide to bolt from this cave I'll have to let them go. Or go with them.   He must have seen me writing: a boy, nine or ten. I was sitting by the cave mouth and saw him moving closer to me, curious; the others didn't notice. I turned my little book towards him. He stared at it, then at my face. I opened to a new page and drew an explosion, with people running. Among the people I drew a smaller one. I aimed my finger at him, then touched the figure. He looked again, then smiled the way all the children here do, like they're the ones protecting you, not the other way round. A woman spoke sharply and he spun towards her. I raised both hands to say to the others: everything's all right. The boy shouted something to them and everyone shushed him, but he pointed at my book, whispering excitedly. So I held it open towards them, saying in my calmest voice that I was only writing down what happened this morning, and the boy wanted to see. Of course they could not understand my words. I tore the page out and gave it to the boy, gesturing for him to show them. He ran it to them, and they gathered round, the boy chattering on, pointing at the picture, then at himself. They stared at it a long time. Then the tallest man straightened up, looking at me with angry eyes. It was the boy's father: the same face. The rest leaned away slightly, looking up at him. I couldn't swallow. The father said seven solemn words. The rest looked shocked, then burst out laughing. The boy was bewildered, but I understood: 'My son does *not* look like that.' I could only shrug and smile, and after that I felt it would be safe for me to stay with them &mdash; as long as we remained in the cave. Over the next few hours we tried to decide what to do next. This was difficult, but my little book helped &mdash; we passed it around, drawing maps and diagrams. I wanted them to understand that we should remain where we were: the explosions had stopped, but that did not mean it was safe to return &mdash; quite the opposite, I felt. Had we all been speaking the same language, I could have given reasons and examples to back up my advice, which in truth was based only on a very bad feeling about what had happened to the town: we should wait until it got dark, then run the other way. But they understood what I meant, though I could see it was very hard for them; they wanted &mdash; needed&mdash; to go back, to see what could be done, to help those left behind. But I knew their home was gone, or in the hands of men who wished them ill, which amounted to the same thing. I had some idea who attacked the town, and if I was right the only safe thing was to vanish, which we had done, into the cave, but after that to put ourselves as far from here as we could, as soon as we could. By now it was quiet back where we came from, which meant the fighting was over; the attackers would likely be preoccupied with securing their position while the light lasted. Then they could start pillaging, inside the perimeter. I knew how to get away: more than once I had paced off every fork and turn of every path out of here. But I'd let my wish to be done with running persuade me to stay another day, and then another, telling myself that my instincts would alert me when it was time to go &mdash; not realizing that that very thought was the signal I was waiting for: the first time I worked out my escape route, I should have used it to escape.   We are twenty-some in number; the boy is not the youngest nor his mother the oldest. I had thought that their leader was the boy's father, then his uncle or even his older brother, for it is the mother's face they both share. When I realized that, time stopped, as the Remnant say. I will now need many words to describe what happened in the space of a dozen heartbeats, but this is how it was: The leader wants to leave. I cannot blame him. He feels trapped; something must be done. Hiding in a cave is cowardly, and he is no coward. On the other hand, he now has all these others under his care, and he must protect them, which, as I know with certainty, means waiting a while longer. I watch him closely as he tells what he is thinking &mdash; perhaps it is well I cannot understand his words, for it helps me concentrate on how he speaks, and how the others take his words. He is easy enough to read: what he is saying now is a repetition of what he's said before. And even if I didn't recognize the pattern of sounds, I would know from his tone that he is marking time, waiting for some weight to shift, in his mind, or among his listeners. I look at him more closely yet: he is younger than I thought at first; the boy is his brother, and the woman is the mother of them both. She herself is suspicious of me, but she is also shrewd: she sees I know something about this situation that no one else does, but she doesn't like it that I am a stranger. The business with the boy and the drawing made an impression on her, but all that did was to keep her from rejecting me outright. She of course is more sensitive than I to the leader's mood as he talks, and knows better what to make of it. So I watch her as well. He is no longer speaking just to me, or only in response to my urging that we stay. What he is saying now is either prologue to the decision he has made, or else an appeal for their help in making it. If it is the first, and he has decided on leaving, I will have to act immediately; if the second, I may have more time to try to persuade him we must not. If I can do this, he will convince the others. I need a sign, and hesitate, knowing that what happens next can be fatal for us all, for I cannot leave them now. And then he gives the signal. As he draws breath to say his piece, he glances at his mother. Before he can utter another sound I go down on my knees before her, grasping her hands. She stiffens, but I hold on. When I look into her face, the tears just come, and I burst out: 'We must stay here until it is dark. We must stay. Please! Please! If we leave now they will see us, and we will be taken, and die. Once it is dark we will be safe. Please! Listen to me! &mdash; and I go on like this, holding her eyes with mine, sobbing, until she softens. I took a terrible chance. I know now &mdash; I knew then &mdash; that the suddenness and force of my movement might have gotten me killed, and had she pulled away, I would be dead now. But she held her ground, and looked into my eyes, which kept the others off, and she did not let me go until she knew entirely who I was, whatever nonsense I was babbling. When I finally felt her assent, in the slight relaxing of her hands, I sank back on my haunches, covered my face and began to bawl &mdash; from relief at that point, for I was sure what she'd decided. It remained to be seen if she could win her son. She took hold of my beard, berated me for making such a spectacle, and threw a handcloth in my face to make me wipe my nose and act like a man. Her son came over, terror turned to rage at me, but she headed him off, acting exasperated, gesturing at me scornfully. Whatever she told him, it persuaded him to forgive my outburst, poor savage that I was, who didn't even know how to speak like a person. Then she turned away in apparent disgust, dismissing me, and, after a moment, he came over and muttered something to me I had no trouble understanding: he knew only too well how it felt to be scolded like that. He asked to see the drawings I'd made earlier, particularly my escape route, and questioned me closely about this and that marking, as if to cement it in his mind, memorizing it so he could help lead the way in the dark.   The worst part was waiting. We were on the far side of the mountain; someone needed to find out what was going on in the town. It was very hard for me to convey this idea, but it worked out like this: in order to approximate the shape of the mountain we perched on, I tore a page from this notebook, folded it, and placed it on a flat rock with the fold side up &mdash; like a blanket hung over a line to make a tent. The town sat at the base of one edge, below the corner; our cave was near the peak at the opposite corner, around on the other side of the fold. For quite a while we conferred over this model, drawing on the page, placing smaller rocks and sticks next to and on it to represent the other features of the terrain, making piles of pebbles where we thought our enemies might be. The rest gathered around us, murmuring and pointing. At last I was fairly sure we all understood what was to happen: after I left, they would wait until the young moon went down; if I did not return by then, they would set off without me, following the map I had made that marked out the escape route.   It did not take long for me to slip along the treeline just below the ridge to the large boulder field at its far end, where it overlooks the town. I stood in the shadows at the top of the clearing for a long time, listening, feeling for the presence of others, before moving out into the dim moonlight towards the promontory. Sure enough, no sooner had I passed through the huge rocks than I could see a sentry standing at the edge of the cliff, looking out over the plateau below, where the town spreads around the foothills at the mountain's base. It was enough to know how close even one of them was to our hiding place, and I should have gone back at once. But I waited, and in a moment another came up to him and said something, and they both laughed. I had a weapon in my kit; it would not have been difficult to kill them both, standing together as they were. But I had to consider that once they were missed, a party would investigate, this area would be searched, and our trail would be found. So I listened to their voices long enough to discern that they expected nothing interesting to happen, and then pulled back into the woods to return to the cave. By the time I got back, the sickle moon was just above the horizon, its pale shimmer pooling in the mouth of our hiding place. It was so quiet inside I thought they had left without me, but as soon as I stepped into the opening of the cave I heard a collective exhalation, and the leader came forward into the light. I reassured them with a few gestures, and they showed me that everyone was ready to go. We watched the curved blade of moon slowly slice into the horizon, then sink behind the faraway mountains. When its last gleam was gone, we left.","attack.html"],

I lit a new one, but it immediately went out: it looked as if there wasn't enough wick, and what was there was frayed.

I stood, not moving, unwilling to breathe, unable to resist the thought that the fate of the flame would somehow be prophetic for us.

Each junior scholar had a student mentor, and although initially I was assigned to someone else &mdash; a cruel person who enjoyed most of all to find (or invent) occasions to inflict bodily suffering upon inferiors &mdash; eventually S___ came to my rescue by trumping this beast in some way, as part of the customary wrangling for status among the seniors, and chose me as payment for the debt my 'owner' had incurred upon losing that particular skirmish.

That year the triennial Convention of the Conference of Professional Scholars was convoked at the Temple, and naturally all students in the School were conscripted to help with its preparation and execution. An innovation in the program that year was a series of informal seminars to be held the day before the Convention officially opened, which would provide an opportunity for younger researchers or lesser-known scholars to talk about their work to anyone who might be interested &mdash; in contrast to the formal, competitive presentations given during the Convention proper, which required stringent vetting beforehand. I was deputized as docent for the initial such forum, reserved for first-time presenters; my charge was to make sure that the room was clean, that there were enough seats, and that the display apparati were in working order. The event was scheduled early in the morning of what also happened to be a minor holiday, so attendance promised to be light &mdash; in the event, counting me on the presenters' side, the actors outnumbered the audience, at least at the moment when the first speaker took the podium. This person was older than the other presenters; he also spoke rather softly, and with a peculiar accent that often made him difficult to understand &mdash; and, rather than utilize the equipment I had so carefully set up for him, he spread out his materials on the worktable at the front of the room, which made them hard to see. When he finished his somewhat too-long talk, he asked for questions, but no one even looked at him; among the few people in the audience, he had put at least two to sleep. And so the next speaker rose to take his place, while the first man fled to the far side of the room, so flustered that he left his exhibition lying on the table. After the rest had given their talks, which were engaging but hardly remarkable, the moderator (who had come in late, with a hangover) tried to get a discussion going amongst the handful of folk in the room. But, as none of the speakers knew each other, and the range of their topics was quite large, it was difficult for them to say anything meaningful about one anothers' work, and the members of the audience were so stupefied (perhaps by the early hour) that not one made a sound. At that point, had I been moderator, I would have sat in utter silence, glaring at the ragtag assembly until someone finally spoke out of desperation. Really: all of these intelligent presenters, even the one who seemed so ill-at-ease, had something interesting to propound (at least to them), and I felt they were entitled to some acknowledgment of their efforts &mdash; and for being there at all, at that ridiculous time of day, only to be met by total apathy. It was shameful. But clearly the moderator, sweating and pale, needed acutely to be somewhere else, and after the briefest pause, he thanked everyone and rushed from the room, without even greeting the guest speakers. Some in the audience stood up and started to leave. I did my best to compensate for this inauspicious beginning by dashing in amongst the presenters and saying something vaguely relevant to each &mdash; except for the first one, whose demonstration, frankly, I did not understand. Going to him at last, I passed by his materials lying on the table, where a large, rugged-looking person with an abundance of black hair all over him stood gazing at them intently. Their owner was still sitting across the room, staring vacantly at the floor. I went over, in order to put him together with the man who was so absorbed in his materials, but when I looked back the huge hairy gentleman was gone. The presenter himself suddenly seemed to realize he'd forgotten his things, and, brushing past me, hurried over to the table, snatched them up, and scurried out of the room. The handful of remaining people chatted easily, the embarrassing ordeal over at last. I began to reset the equipment for the next session, which concluded my duties in that venue, and in a moment the room was empty. Before departing myself, out of some absurd sense of etiquette and belated fellow-feeling, I tried to recall something of the first speaker's exposition, but nothing came to mind except a fleeting impression of ancient texts in a scattered heap on the table. And then I forgot about it: it promised to be a terribly busy day.   The next week, I think it was, I finally had a chance to be alone with my dear friend S___, who seemed sad and upset, but wouldn't say why, no matter how much I teased and cajoled. I took offense, and said something I shouldn't have, got the same in return, and just like that we were no longer lovers, and spoke not another word to each other for the rest of the year, at the end of which S___ graduated and took employment in the outside world. It was badly done, which I regretted, but shortly I formed the opinion that we had been heading for breakup a while; I eased my conscience by proposing to myself that the stress of the Convention had loosened our ties more quickly than either of us expected. But of course that was nonsense. We were simply too different from each other, and the time had come to accept that and to part. A distraction from my confessedly less than total heartbreak was provided by a scandal that swept through the Temple School like an epidemic after the Convention was over: it was learned that the Council of Governors had imposed Censure and Confiscation upon one of the presenters, a sanction unheard of in living memory. (My ancient instructor in medicine told our class that he remembered his grandfather telling him that when he was a boy, just such a punishment had been meted out upon an apostate scholar who was later burned alive for refusing to recant his heretical pronouncements &mdash; or else his grandfather told him that his grandfather had told him the story; my poor old preceptor couldn't remember.) There eventually emerged two theories vying for adherents in our little community: the first was that the disgraced man was a mere charlatan trying to pass off forged documents as a major find in his province, whatever that was. The other was that he was a formidable heretic, on a mission to recruit disciples to the proposition that the Ancients were not deities at all, but ordinary human beings like ourselves, and that they had brought about the calamity which destroyed their Great Civilization entirely on their own, through their own foolishness, or negligence, or both. Frankly, I didn't know many among my fellows who cared much whether the Ancients were deities or apes who lived in trees; most thought the whole thing was just a fairy tale our elders told us to scare us into doing what they told us to do... When asked which I thought was the true story, I replied that I failed to see why both couldn't be true: the Great Heretic needed documents to bolster his outrageous claims, so he forged them himself. But when I found out who the dangerous felon actually was &mdash; that mousy little pedagogue from the provinces whose bumbling, impenetrable talk I had set up at the first seminar of the Convention &mdash; I couldn't help myself: I exploded in laughter. The person telling me this was a new acquaintance, a fervid partisan of the Great Heretic Hypothesis, and was dismayed by my reaction. I didn't want to hurt this person's feelings (the poor thing was rather sweet, and very good-looking), so I pretended I had misunderstood what was said, acting as if I'd thought someone else was meant. Then I looked up, for I sensed someone's eyes upon me. Not far away, there was S___, certainly close enough to have witnessed the entire exchange. Never have I received a look so devastating as the one I saw directed at me in that moment. I was instantly ashamed, and looked down. When I raised my eyes again, S____ was gone.   After completing studies, I was first posted quite a distance from the City, as far from human development as one can get and still have running water, it seemed to me. This was bad enough, but my employer was a very stupid man, no doubt the relative of some minor official in the City, who had less idea of how to make use of an ambitions and clever young person than a dog knows how to employ a songbird. One day, carrying out some pointless errand for my ridiculous boss, I descried someone I thought I knew from my years at the Temple School: a very large very hirsute person &mdash; yes! it was the rugged gentleman I last saw at that classroom worktable all those years before, studying the Great Heretic's lecture aids! Having completed the tedious chore I had been sent to that desolate neighborhood to perform, I followed him &mdash; as much to defer my return to more donkey work at home as to satisfy my curiosity about what he was doing just then just there. I had completely forgotten him since that day, but of course I recognized him at once: all that hair! how did he manage it? The answer: he didn't! I was just amusing myself with this observation when he abruptly vanished near the canal path just up ahead. I hurried to the corner, but as soon as I rounded it I was seized and lifted off my feet, finding myself a-dangle over the turbid muck of the canal. I heard nearby boatmen hoot and shout as I was shaken like a puppy by the scruff of the neck, and began shrieking, of course, which brought on a surge of laughter from all sides, until at last I was pulled back from danger and flung down upon the path. The hairy giant bent over me, his face the size of my entire torso, inspecting me like a bug. Then he asked, in an oddly gentle voice, 'Is there some way I can assist you, young person?' I am afraid I burst into tears, to the great delight of everyone watching, which I imagined comprised the entire population of that miniscule settlement. Grasping my arm with his huge paw, he lifted me up, even offering to help me brush myself off, but I fought free of this intention as forcefully as I could. Then he said, his voice kind but firm, 'Walk with me, will you? I would like you to see something.' Nearly numb with terror, I could only nod assent. He headed up the path beside the canal, with me mostly trotting to keep up, while the boatmen teased me about my flight o'er the waters, and he replied amiably that he'd be glad to do the same for each of them if they didn't tend to their own affairs. Shortly we turned up a side lane, at the end of which stood a two-story structure I thought might be a stables. He unlocked a door on one side, and we went up a flight of stairs, emerging into an airy bright loft lit by windows in the ceiling. He told me he was going to make us bark tea, a concoction he said he had learned from a dear friend, with whom he believed I was acquainted. I could not think to whom he was referring, but suddenly I grasped that he must mean that ragged researcher at the Convention those years ago! Seeing me realize this, he smiled and gestured for me to have a look around, then turned away to prepare the tea in a little galley tucked under one hip of the roof. Although in part I wanted to run away as fast as I could, I also found the giant's workshop fascinating, impossible to resist the desire to explore it. Standing tables ran the length of each side, with shelves built above them all the way to the ceiling &mdash; high windows in each wall also had shelves tacked across them, and even the door through which we had entered was encrusted with hooks and compartments crammed with stuff. And every storage space was filled, or nearly so, with curiously-wrought objects whose purpose was difficult to guess. Additional workbenches and heavy cases sat here and there on the floor, all of them covered with tools and mechanical devices of mysterious function... When the tea was ready, we sat on stools at the end of one workbench, and he asked me if I liked my work, in a manner that implied he already knew all about it. I was still so intimidated that I could only mumble a reply, but then he said, 'I am glad you came to me first, since I did not know quite how to approach you.' This astonished me, of course, and he smiled as if embarrassed. 'It is unclear how we should start. May I try?' He waited only a moment, then continued before I could reply: 'I saw you earlier, and recognized you at once from the Convention some years ago &mdash; the seminar you moderated so skillfully.' 'I? Moderated?' 'I was especially grateful for your kindness to the first presenter, who had so much difficulty with his materials.' I was unsure where this exchange was tending, and said nothing. 'I can confirm that it was his first attempt,' he said, reading my mind exactly. 'Confirm?' I couldn't help asking. He regarded me a moment, weighing something. Then, 'I expect too much too soon,' he said, pushing back his stool as if to stand. 'More tea?' 'No, thank you.' 'Its unusual texture is not to your liking.' 'It is unusual...' 'Another sip may work some magic on you...' 'Very well,' I said, with an attempt to smile, and raised it to my lips again. I could hardly stand the smell &mdash; which was, to say the least, earthy &mdash; and so I hadn't actually tasted the stuff yet. But after a tiny swallow, I felt a kind of soothing warmth spread through my chest, so I nodded with some appreciation. He carried on. 'I believe you know more about our mutual acquaintance than you feel you can &mdash; or should &mdash; confide to me; your discretion is wise. But let me share with you what I know, to help you decide your course hereafter.' He raised his eyebrows, each as broad as my thumb, and I nodded again. He got up then, moved a rolling ladder from one wall to another, then climbed up to a high shelf and fetched down a small metal case, which, after descending again, he placed on the workbench between us. Taking a key from a ring on his belt, he unlocked the case and swung the lid back. Inside, I saw a pile of tatty-looking documents, much marked up in a singular hand. I looked up to see him watching my reaction, then asked, 'His?' 'Yes. Discarded drafts.' 'But,' I protested, 'he must have been ordered to turn over all his materials to the Council.' 'I stole these from him before he could submit them.' 'You stole them?' 'Yes. Otherwise they would have been lost, along with the rest.' I was horrified: this man was a criminal. If I did not report his theft immediately, I would go to the gibbet with him. But I knew instantly I would never do that. And I could see he already knew this, or else I would be sucking mud into my lungs at the bottom of the canal instead of gazing at this most precious treasure.   So began my double life as an active intriguer in a vast, multigenerational maze of interconvolute, often conflicting conspiracies: large, small, local, universal, ad-hoc, everlasting. My part in this web of plots and plans is MY precious treasure, whatever else I have been privileged to contribute to the story of the race: to spend the rest of my life tracking down, mapping out, and articulating the whole tangle &mdash; whether or not, I must say, I ever understand it at all. Callous as it sounds, the destruction of the Temple has made my mission incomparably easier, by bringing to an end the longest-lived and most diabolical connivance of them all: that is, the conspiracy to prop up the Ancients as Deities who somehow rule our world from on high, bestowing their authority on every rug-chewing monster who ever dreamed of enslaving the world. What makes me bark with astonishment, however, is the thought of that pedantic little scholar-manqué being at the center of the whole cockeyed tapestry &mdash; for nothing could have been further from his intention or character than the desire to bring about the demolition of an entire world. And yet he did no less, with his sorry little lecture, which at the time no one but my bear-like host knew in the slightest how to really interpret. The rest of this document I am here contriving, should it survive, is dedicated to telling you, dear myReader, how I came to know all about it. And then to make this small contribution to the furtherance of its utterly revolutionary project.   My new guide and teacher was not himself a principal player in the game, but without him I would not have been brought into the long, multi-branching stream of its intrigues, and the secret history you are now reading would not exist. His pedigree was long in another of the oldest conspiracies of all, a shadowy fellowship of schemers, saboteurs, and mere Keepers of the Secret, which formed during the brutal reign of the last Golias, a vicious Persecuter, many generations ago. This clandestine cabal had no name &mdash; presumably for greater secrecy! My mentor would never tell me his name either, so I will simply refer to him as the Fellow. (When we worked together, I called him 'Master', which satisfied him well.) The Fellow believed himself to be the Last One of his order, if I may call it that, and his mission was, as far as I could discover, to Watch and Wait &mdash; for What, he never fully articulated (at least not to me), but I did learn that when he appeared in that Convention pre-seminar years before, it was somehow Revealed to him that the Waiting was Over. What electrified him, of course, was the ancient archive allegedly discovered by... &mdash; now what shall we call him, that ham-handed literary sleuth from the hinterlands? If I knew his name I have forgotten it; besides, those old writings brought down enough trouble on his head without my adding to the stain on his memory, so for mercy's sake (and my convenience) let us call him only the Scholar from the House in the Mountains, which indeed rings finely in the mind's mouth, don't you think? Well. To state the matter succinctly, the artifact that finally brought purpose to the Fellow's life was that ratty old archive of documents discovered by our Mountain House Scholar. I shall expound their significance as I can, but the conspiracy they hint at is the oldest and (therefore?) most tortuous of them all. Before I can do that, I must provide a fuller context for myScholar's presentation and its reception. My official employer, he who had dispatched me to the rustic province where the moment of my life came upon me, served the very Council who pronounced that dreadful sentence of Censure and Confiscation upon the dear deluded Scholar. As I may have intimated, this employer of mine was a dolt, and, fortunately for all concerned, was not himself a full Council member, but rather some full member's deputy assistant flunky or something. The Fellow, my true master, knew the Council well, which explains his laying hands on me that afternoon: consider how conveniently I, a well-connected idiot's intelligent servant, was placed to further the Fellow's mission of paying back that corrupt cabal for the heinous injustice against his friend &mdash; which mission, I must admit, I was happy enough to facilitate, once I found out about it. I mean: who could resist the opportunity to avenge every villainy every petty, craven bureaucrat ever inflicted on anybody? by becoming a SPY? I would have slaughtered a rampaging bull every morning of the world to win such an assignment, if I believed there were any deities anywhere who might be pleased with such a sacrifice. Put simply, I was elated, and immediately set about to dig out everything I could of the real story behind the Scholar's disgraceful maltreatment. This proved less difficult than I would have imagined, for, as often happens, my employer was an inveterate gossip as well as a dunce. I innocently mentioned to him that 'a schoolmate' who had been present at myScholar's little talk &mdash; and who had fallen asleep almost immediately, it was so boring &mdash; was astonished at the uproar it caused. Well, this was catnip to Silkywits, as my employer imagined himself to be, and he at once spilled to me everything he knew &mdash; which wasn't much beyond what everyone else was whispering, but his breathless narrative did contain a gem or two whose significance he completely missed, though I did not. The Council member he served during the Convention was among the minority who actually opposed punishing the Scholar severely for his 'heresy', and of course my employer was 'in the know' (as he thought) about the debates that raged behind the Council's closed doors &mdash; through which doors he was ordered to traipse, bearing requests for more research and bringing back fruits of same to his own master. And because he was a complete ninny, my employer was also a fervent partisan of the Great Heretic hypothesis, and thus was forced (as he revealed to me in strictest confidence) to spy upon his superior in order to aid the righteous side (who were ravening to impose the archaic cruelty of Censure and Confiscation) in bringing justice down upon my poor Scholar's balding pate. The story he conveyed to me (in hushed tones, eyebrows awiggle) formed an appalling jumble of truth, rumor, and fiction that could make sense only to a dunderhead like himself, and so I shall pass over all its absurd and incommensurable particulars in order to summarize my conclusions. For the Council, the issue was never whether the Ancients were truly divine, but only what people could be required to say they believed &mdash; that is, this was a matter of defending Authority, not actual Truth. To say Anything at variance with what the Council had decreed was to challenge its right to compel Obedience &mdash; a right that amounted to nothing less than the power to dictate How It Is (actually, How You Will Say It Is, or I Will Make You Regret It...), in this or any domain within the Council's authority, and, for that matter, in discussing any subject upon which the Council wished to make any pronouncement whatsoever. If anyone (even an innocent booby like myScholar) was permitted &mdash; no: was seen to be permitted to get away with making such a challenge, however humbly or clumsily he put it forth &mdash; this would amount to inviting others to do the same, and such attacks, once begun, or so the Council feared, would inevitably increase in strength and numbers until the entire edifice of its dominion came crashing down. (Which, in a way, is exactly what happened.) Nothing new here: one masters such sophomoric analysis when one is too young to even know what a paramour is, let alone have one, but when a bright person arrives at the age of intellectual enthusiasm, and the newly-acquired ability to comprehend profound ideas is suddenly ignited by a capacity for strong, focused feeling, thereafter every realization is illumined and warmed (if not incinerated) by the fire of robust emotion. Such was the case with me in that moment of my life: the plight of that naive bookish didact caught in the Temple's degraded political apparatus certainly outraged me, and at the same time I suddenly felt the means to avenge injustice coming into my hands: in short, I acquired a Mission of my own. Bear with me, dear myReader, only a little more background is required to complete my apology. The guilty secret the Coucil was so frantic to protect was the inheritance handed down (or up, to use its peculiar spatialization of time) from its forbidding ancestor, the Office of Inquiry, which flourished (if that's the proper word) in the hoary old Age of the Warlords, and whose charge it was to 'ensure proper reverence for the Deities' (ie, the Ancients), by whose authority the Golias (as such Chief Thugs were called at the time) was said to rule. At the moment of the Scholar's presentation, this rimy concept was already losing adherents at an increasing pace &mdash; but at the same time, resistance to its elimination seemed to be stiffening amongst the traditionalist element of the Conference, even winning new adherents, my fatuous employer among them. The Scholar's timing could not have been worse: had he been able to wait until the next Convention (and three years' practicing his presentation skills would not have been wasted time), there was a chance this flare-up of reactionary spirit might have burned itself out, and his proposition would have been welcomed warmly; he might even have been crowned with the laurel for most significant research ever in history &mdash; or maybe not, but at least he would not have been terrorized with the threat of being devoured alive by wild beasts in the arena, which I know for a fact he was. But he did present his ideas to the wrong people too soon, and the Council did land on him with all four feet, and that was the end of Freedom of Inquiry in the Conference for what remained of its life. This overblown act of repression inspired a fierce and committed reprisal among the junior membership of the Conference, whose cause I believe I would have joined had I remained long enough in the City, but I only found out about their plans when they were brought to fruition, and the Temple was a smoke-belching crater in the blasted earth. Whatever brought down the Temple also annihilated the proud Council, the mighty Conference, the Great City itself, or that part of it, which was shunned thereafter as if the ground itself were cursed &mdash; as it certainly seemed to be, given the venomous stench of the place for years afterward. In short, it wasn't just pride, or ambition, or even rabid greed that annihilated the Temple and the Great City whose crown it was. It was fear, stupidity, and the sheer nonsense that results from their conjointure &mdash; had those who wished to defend the Scholar (or at least oppose his being punished severely) actually shown the slightest conviction, all those poisonous fearmongers would have run away like the bullies they were. (But then I never would have found my mission!)   I don't know what happened to him, my mentor the Fellow. One day I appeared as usual at his atelier to find the door hanging off its hinges and his workshop completely ransacked, apparently by burglars: most of his tools were missing and the devices smashed, the shelves pulled down and the furniture upended, and the usual disgusting signature of such an operation was placed like a centerpiece atop the counter where we had eaten our lunch. I picked through the wreckage and managed to find the metal case containing the Scholar's drafts; it was battered but still locked, and I took it away with me, managing to slip past an officer who had just assumed his post at the head of the lane &mdash; to guard the crime scene against further depredation, I supposed at the time, unless he was its perpetrator, a surmise that came to me later. When I returned to my lodging, my few belongings were stacked on the street outside the door, which my employer was just locking before absconding himself. He hastily wished me luck and scooted away, a coward as well as a moron. I took a change of clothes and some toiletries from the pile of my things on the sidewalk, wrapped them in a pillowcase, and left the rest there for anyone who needed it. I don't know where my employer thought he was going, but I set off directly the other way. And that is the end of my story, except to say that, after a difficult and exhausting journey, I made it back to the City, and have found a little corner in which to dwell: believe it or not, I live (or at least sleep) inside a giant bell that lies on its side amidst the rubble of its collapsed tower. No one else lives nearby, which suits me well, and I would make a terrible neighbor. One last item: I reuinted, briefly, with my school chum, S___, who lives in, or haunts, the Temple ruins, not far away. I went there just to see what was left, and there was S___, prowling the precinct, muttering. Mad, it looked to me. I thought I should greet my old sweetheart, but the look on that once-beloved face was so upsetting I turned aside onto another path, and in a moment my old friend was out of sight. But I know where to return if I can get up the courage... When you find this lengthy missive, dear myReader, please accept my greetings and regards &mdash; as well as apologies for whatever inconvenience you've been forced to undergo in order to locate it at all, and then for whatever misfortunes of expression you find here: I can only plead my implausible situation as the cause of my failure to repair them. No excuse, I know. Wails and clanging in the distance &mdash; these alarums used to terrify me, portending some disaster as they do by definition, but I now regard them as a sign that some vestige of the civilization into which I was born has not perished utterly from the earth. In that reassurance, I shall now close, deposit this folorn message in its resting place &mdash; inside that battered metal case (atop the Scholar's drafts) tucked up near the clapper-hook in this wonderful old bell &mdash; and take a little nap on the rags and leaves that serve as my bed. Looks like rain. That is well &mdash; the bell not only keeps me dry, it sings!","conspiracy.html"],

I was their acolyte: a wonderful life. I owned nothing, required nothing, desired nothing, except to spend each day adoring them. I dwelt forever in paradise itself.   Then came the others. I had seen them before, but only with each other: they had never come to me. But when at last they did, they bore me away with them, wherever they went, and they went everywhere. And wherever I went with them, they thought of other places, and made plans to go there; they remembered places they had been before, and arranged to return. Nowhere we went did we ever arrive. And everywhere they went, they brought their gear; they contrived to bring their families and friends with them, in their gear, just as they were taken by their families and friends in their gear, wherever they went; their dear ones were with them always, everywhere they went, and so were their heroes, their enemies, their bosses, their underlings. They spoke constantly: of love, of anger, and of fear; of time, and of distance; they devised great constructions of their speakings, on these topics and on others, and linked them together into a majestic discourse. They poured from one place to another, their faces shining as in sunlight; but the light did not come from the sun, upon which they no longer gazed by day, nor upon the moon and the stars by night, but rather they gazed upon images of these wondrous objects captured by devices they had contrived for this purpose, and the devices displayed them by means of their own light, so that the images could be studied and described and linked together as well. And they exclaimed over what they had done, and were doing, and would do in days to come; they exclaimed and exclaimed, and could not stop; and multitudes joined them, from everywhere else that there was, exclaiming in their turn, joining their voices to those of the multitudes they encountered in a ringing cry of amazement and wonder at all that they had made and joined together, causing the sky to thunder with their noise. I heard the heavens ring with a mighty sound, but when I looked up, I saw only the moon and the stars by night, and the bright sun by day. Clouds drifted before them, then passed slowly away; trees waved in the wind, then were still in the cool of the evening; water surged and ebbed along the shore, hissing softly like a sigh. I turned round, and knew that I had dreamed, for the earth was empty, the deities silent. I was alone, and at peace.","deities.html"],

By habit (and maybe by nature) I want to retreat from that feeling of being pulled in &mdash; out of caution, of course, but also out of a sense that it's a dream: the reality of my life is only just my sitting here, listening to the sounds of the town as it wakes up and begins the business of the day: a far-away wagon beginning to roll, the fire in the forge roaring up, the grit of heels on the cobblestones, a sleepy greeting and a shivering answer, then two share a laugh.

	["Egderus and the Good Doctor","The Good Doctor had been appointed Prior to the Chief Inquirer, and I was to be the Good Doctor's secretary. He told me that the only reason he was bringing me with him from Mountain House was that my handscript was legible and he would be needing documents prepared immediately, but that as soon as he could find an accomplished scribe he planned to get rid of me. I did not entirely believe this: for one thing, I never entirely believed anything he said, but I also suspected that my removal had more to do with separating me from the Superius Frater and possibly from Robenc than with the beauty of my handscript. I did not know why I thought that, but subsequent events proved my intuition correct. My first duties were to catalog and summarize the testimonies of the various clients whom the Office of Inquiry had questioned, and to make copies of those interviews which the Good Doctor designated as worthy of further attention. As Prior the Good Doctor would be unlikely to conduct many of these sessions himself, but he did oversee the Examiners, and spent many of his mornings observing them at work. Every Examiner had his own scriptor who transcribed each interrogation, and it was from the ranks of these scriptores that the Good Doctor imagined (or contended) he would find my replacement. At first they resented me because I had entered at an already fairly exalted rank &mdash; one usually became scriptor after an apprenticeship, which I obviously had not undergone; and only after years as scriptor might one be chosen to follow his master up, should the Examiner in question be promoted. In addition, it was unusual for the Prior or any official above the rank of Examiner to be brought in from outside. Apparently the Good Doctor was a less suspicious case than myself because, I discovered, he had worked as an Examiner before being called (or sent) to Mountain House. I was billeted with the scriptores, and by my humility and good humor I soon convinced them that I was not to blame for my present position, and that there was much I needed to learn from them. Within a short time I got to know how they worked: speed was everything in transcribing a client's interview, and so they used a system of abbreviated characters, amounting to a kind of code, which only another scriptor could decipher. This code was not at all regular, and nowhere was it written down so that a lay person could use it. The characters of this shorthand consisted mostly of pictographs which over generations of rapid writing no longer resembled their original lineaments. However, once the fundamental characters were learned &mdash; man, woman, client, Examiner, ask, speak, scream, faint, revive, confess, beginning, and end &mdash; it was possible to see the progress of a session in the notae of its scriptor, though it took much more experience to be able to make out what the actual questions, answers, and confessions were. What I was cataloging for the Good Doctor were called 'realizations', logs of sessions written in ordinary characters, a task the scriptor was supposed to perform directly after the end of an examination and then submit to the Examiner for approval. But an interrogation could take place at any hour, in the dark or the light, and might last for an entire day or longer. The Examiner's work was complete when he asked his last question; not so for the scriptor: even though utterly drained, he still had to produce a timely realization. So the scriptores covered for each other &mdash; an off-duty scriptor was always 'on call' to complete a realization for one of his fellows, with the understanding that this favor would be repaid when his turn came around for a long or grueling session. In the beginning I was bewildered by the varieties of heresy that the Office was prosecuting &mdash; my own understanding of orthodoxy was neither deep nor comprehensive &mdash; but I soon realized that what a client professed or believed was not really important. What mattered was the clash of wits and will, cat against mouse. Only rarely did the mouse somehow manage to dodge into death before the cat was done with its game. My friends the scriptores were, in their own minds, nothing more sinister than simple artisans. They took pride in their work, but that work was writing, not torture. In every aspect of their lives except the exercise of their craft they were what they conceived themselves to be &mdash; loyal, honest, kind, hard-working &mdash; and besides, what way out was there for them? I could not respect them, but I could understand their belief that they were making the best of a bad situation. My contact with the Examiners, on the other hand, opened new realms of feeling within me: I had known fear and anger, even a kind of restless dissatisfaction with my life; from my fellows' masters, however, I learned loathing, disgust, and, ultimately, despair. They professed to be the guardians of faith, but they believed nothing; they deplored the methods they were forced to use against heresy, but inflicting agony upon others gave them deep pleasure; they professed love for the truth, but they hated everything &mdash; their victims, themselves, everything that lived. And from both I learned hypocrisy, the basic mode of behavior in such a situation. Curiously, while hypocrisy masks everything, it hides nothing; but in a short time under such a regime one ceases to care what the truth is... The Good Doctor rarely conducted an examination himself, but when he did, I was his scriptor. At first, of course, I had trouble keeping up, not having learned more than the basic characters of scriptorial shorthand. To make up this deficit, I devised my own system, which naturally even the other scriptores could not decipher. I found this system useful in making observations about the Good Doctor's technique, while at the same time keeping up with the proceedings. And he was very good at this work: I observed with surprise that, though in ordinary intercourse he was waspish and excitable, in the examination chamber he rarely raised his voice, never himself touched a client, and only brought in the Rectifier ('Bone-Snapper') when he had exhausted every means of mental torment in his repertoire, which was large and varied. Before the events I am about to relate, I only witnessed one session in which the Bone-snapper actually had to do anything &mdash; every other time his mere appearance caused the client to capitulate &mdash; and I was ill for a week afterward, in a fever of revulsion. It was then I realized that I had come to hate as well as fear the Good Doctor, and to desire, if not yet to plan, to somehow bring him down. And, as the Remnant say, desire begets occasion. But again, I anticipate. My hatred healed me, as it were, and I was soon back at work. I began to read more deeply in the records of the Office's proceedings, going further and further down in time, until I had a clear understanding of the Good Doctor's history with the Office. He had been removed several years before in a purge engineered by the previous Prior, seemingly at the Chief Inquirer's suggestion, but there were hints that the old Golias himself had wanted the Good Doctor gone. The reasons for his removal from the Office were nowhere to be found, but it was clear that the Good Doctor had retaliated in some way, procuring his predecessor's demise when the present Golias ascended to the throne. There were references in some of the documents to an exchange of letters between the Chief Inquirer and an unnamed monk in an unnamed community, but none of the correspondence itself appeared in the archives. In my youthful enthusiasm, I immediately convinced myself that the Good Doctor had been sent to spy on the Superius Frater at Mountain House, though such vague allusions as I found could have been to anyone anywhere. And it never occurred to me until much later to ask why a spy would be sent to Mountain House at all. Time passed, and the opportunity to realize my vindictive intentions arrived at last. A man known only as the Historian appeared among the clients of the Office, and he successfully resisted the exertions of at least two of our best Examiners before he came to the Good Doctor's attention. The Good Doctor quickly took a keen interest in this Historian, and observed several sessions with a third Examiner, whom he subsequently dismissed for incompetence, and took over the inquiry himself. The Historian was not a tall man, and he limped, but he was sturdily built, and had shaggy blond hair, deep blue eyes, and a rugged face. In short, he was beautiful, and I was instantly infatuated. He seemed to notice this, though the Good Doctor did not, and took what occasion he could to return my stare, at first with anger in his eyes, then a question, and finally a command: if I loved him, I must help him. I had no idea how, but I promised him with my eyes that I would. This interchange took place just before the Good Doctor, as if to confirm my evil resolve, commanded the Bone-Snapper to break the man's thumbs. When I returned to my cubicle outside the Good Doctor's study in order to prepare the realization, I was in a frenzy of rage, muttering and weeping, pacing impotently back and forth. I had not noticed that there was someone waiting inside the Good Doctor's study, himself pacing to and fro by the door. When I did see this figure I jumped, which caused me to fall over my stool with a great crash. The man rushed out. It was Robenc. His features were larger and somewhat coarsened, he had put on weight, and there was some gray in his beard. He helped me up and asked where the Good Doctor was; I thanked him and told him my master would be returning any minute. At the sound of my voice Robenc looked at me sharply, then he broke into a smile. 'Ah! The Man Egderus! Of course! The Bad Quack took you with him when he landed this fat job. How are you, my angry young friend? But you've grown &mdash; or at least filled out! You have the face of a man now. And your voice has settled down, I notice. Well! Just coming from an examination, are we? Who with, or am I not allowed to ask?' 'You may ask, but I am not authorized to answer.' This caused him to laugh out loud. 'Fearless Man Egderus! Impressed by no uniform or badge of office! How have you escaped the Bone-Snapper with a sharp tongue like that!? Or are you merely presuming upon the protection of the Good Doctor's skirts?' 'The Prior will return shortly. If you would rather not wait, I will tell him that you were here, and he will contact you later.' 'Do not be angry, Brother Egderus. I should not tease a serious young man such as yourself. I am not your enemy. Do you not remember me?' 'You are Phylax Robenc.' 'Phylax no longer, but Robenc just the same. I, too, have ascended in the world. I am now Praetor Robenc, commander of our ruler's Bodyguard. I protect more than just a sleepy group of scholars in a far-off retreat these days &mdash; everyone in this city is under my watchful eye. Once again, your safety is in my hands.' His voice was jocular, and he smiled as he spoke, but in his eyes was a hard, glittering light. I had felt those eyes probing me once before, but this time I was not a youth who felt he had to protect his master and so barked like a little dog at every word Robenc spoke. This time I wished to destroy my master, and was interested in anyone's help. 'It is good to see you again, sir.' 'Is it? Is it indeed?' I met his eyes and held them. 'It is indeed.' At that moment the Good Doctor returned. He did not see Robenc right away. 'I want that realization immediately. And I am not to be disturbed.' 'Apologies, Prior, but you must see me now,' Robenc said. His manner had completely changed. He was cold, peremptory. The Good Doctor took a step back in surprise. In his face I saw three things: anger, then fear, then deeper anger. He wheeled on me. 'Why did you not tell me that Praetor Robenc was here?' He cuffed me on the ear, then pushed me out of the way and entered his study, turning back inside the door. 'Come in, Praetor.' 'This will not take much of your time, Prior. I know you are busy.' I watched him enter the study, then the door closed. I waited a long moment to see if the Good Doctor would come back out, then swung open the door of the document closet. Some time before, I noticed that one of the shelves was loose, and in trying to repair it had found that it slid back in such a way that a small person such as myself could climb in. A recess in the back of the closet actually opened into the space behind the wall of the Prior's study, from whence it was possible to hear most of what was said in the room. I had only used it once or twice before, the last time being when the Good Doctor dismissed the third Examiner who had been working on my Historian. Even as I first crawled into the recess I could hear the sharpness in the voices of both men. It was clear they hated each other; perhaps now I would find out why. 'It does not matter how I know,' Robenc was saying, 'The Golias wishes the man released.' 'Forgive me if I am perhaps overcareful, Praetor. Should I not be hearing this from the Chief Inquirer, rather than yourself? Strictly speaking, you are not my superior, and I may not obey even a direct order from you without approval.' 'It should be sufficient for you that the Golias has spoken.' 'Ah, but has he spoken? I don't wish to appear ill-mannered, but why should I believe you?' 'Why should you not believe me?' 'Because you bring no proof &mdash; ' 'Proof?! What proof do you need? Do you want the Golias himself to come here to beg for his friend's release?' 'Ah! So he is a personal friend of the Golias, this man you think we have in our care.' Robenc said nothing for a moment. 'The man is unquestionably &quot;in your care&quot; &mdash; ' The Good Doctor interrupted sharply. 'Did that young fool tell you that?' 'What young fool?' 'Egderus, my secretary.' Robenc laughed. 'No, no. I was merely teasing him about our last encounter &mdash; ' 'At Mountain House?' 'Yes. I interviewed him &mdash; ' 'I remember, and he told you a lot of nonsense, embarrassing both the Superius Frater and myself. I hope you did not believe him.' 'Egderus was not the only one to tell me about Gig chasing the brothers with his axe &mdash; ' 'But Gig never chased him. Of that I hope you were convinced. Egderus never went more than a few yards from the House because of that ridiculous leg of his &mdash; ' 'It hardly matters now, Prior. And all the young fool said to me today was that you would return shortly.' 'Did you ever solve the mystery of Phylax Gig's death?' 'No.' There was a pause, while the Good Doctor waited for Robenc to say more. 'I was called back to my lord's service before I could complete the investigation.' 'What became the official version of the story?' 'That Phylax Gig died from an accidental fall.' 'Which tore him limb from limb? And left his head perched on top of a boulder a hundred paces away? You should have had me conduct your investigation, Praetor. Then you would know what happened.' 'Unfortunately for us both, Prior, we have other work to do now. I had hoped you would be more cooperative. The Golias will not be pleased.' 'I have no wish to disappoint the Golias, but your request is irregular in the extreme. First of all, I am not convinced that this man you describe is even with us at all. What is his name? The Historian? That is not a name.' At the mention of my new friend I jerked upright, knocking my head against a post. The two men must have heard me, for there was silence for a moment. Then I heard footsteps coming towards the door! 'I do not know his name,' Robenc said. The footsteps stopped. 'I have not met this man. The Golias only told me that he was a friend, a school fellow or something. Apparently he is also the younger son of a prominent citizen, who has gotten himself into some scrape, and the Golias wishes to rescue him, discreetly. That is why the Chief Inquirer has not been approached. Indeed, I would not be bothering you at all, had you not taken over his examination &mdash; ' 'Who told you this? Whom have you placed here to spy on me? It must be Egderus.' The footsteps started toward the door again. I was frozen with fright. I would never make it to my desk before the Good Doctor got there. But Robenc started speaking again, and the footsteps stopped. I struggled back out of the recess as silently as I could, then slid the shelf into place. I was just closing the document closet when the Good Doctor's door opened violently and he charged at me. 'What are you doing? Why are you not working on that realization?' 'I am working on the realization, sir. I just needed some sand &mdash; ' 'You were eavesdropping!' 'But how, sir?' This was almost a mistake, because the Good Doctor looked suspiciously at the document closet. I followed his eyes. 'Sand, sir. For the realization. I keep it in the closet, on the bottom shelf.' Robenc was standing in the doorway, looking not at the Good Doctor but at me. I did not dare meet his eyes while the Good Doctor was peering into my face, but when he shoved me out of the way to get at the closet, I managed to nod quickly to Robenc, hoping he would understand that I would help him if I could. 'Please, Prior,' he said. 'Discipline your secretary later, if you must. It is imperative that we resolve this issue immediately.' The Good Doctor ignored him, opening the closet door and pushing everything around. 'If you will only tell me what you are looking for, sir, I can probably find it.' He wheeled on me, eyes burning fiercely. 'I know you were eavesdropping.' I met his gaze. 'I do not lie, sir. Not to you, not to anyone.' For a moment we stared at each other thus, then his eyes flickered. 'Get back to work.' He pushed me out of his way and stormed back into his study, causing Robenc to have to back out of the doorway before his charge. The door closed again. I resolved to fix the shelf so that only I knew how to remove it. In the meantime I had the realization to begin. I worked rapidly, so that when the door opened again I had perhaps half a page completed. The two men were saying farewell in a polite if strained tone. Robenc left without looking at me. As soon as he was out of sight, the Good Doctor hauled me into his study and beat me severely, paying particular attention to my lame leg.","EgderusandtheGoodDoctor.html"],
	["Egderus and the Historian","It was Markito who found him, sitting inside the old guard tower, his back propped against the doorframe so that he could see the cliff opposite. He told me the man was dead, but when we entered the enclosure my leg buckled and I fell against him, nearly knocking over the stool upon which he had evidently been propped. Markito grabbed for him, but the man's hand went out to steady himself. I had not yet seen his face. When I did, I nearly keeled over myself. It was the Historian, my old infuation. Let me just say, before I go on, that I have entrusted everything to Markito, a tiny man deformed like myself: somewhat more afflicted in that respect, but also more cheerful. He has joy, which I have lost; if I ever possessed it, I cannot remember. Such people are blessed, and a blessing to others. But Markito is also cunning enough to know that it is best not to let others know he is smart enough to know that. Markito will find a way to preserve this remarkable tale; I am too old and tired, also too much known. Already some suspect people have come sniffing around on account of rumors in the town that there is some treasure buried in these cliffs. This is true, of course, although the treasure is not what these covetous people think. Markito knows everything I can tell him, and what I cannot accomplish he will finish, at least as far as recording this extraordinary history is concerned. Markito was almost correct: my friend was near death. He would not let me move him back to the house, even though it would soon get very cold: we could smell snow in the air. I saw he was sure he would die on the way, and I believe he was right. He also seemed to want to spend his last moments gazing upon that cliff face.... [======lacuna======]   Markito spent most of that day scrambling around the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. I hobbled back to the House to arrange for the Historian's final disposition. No one was to learn that this dead stranger was known to me. We buried him beside the old tower on the bluff above the lake. Considering what followed, it might have been better to drop the body over the cliff behind the House, where his pursuers would have found it and given up the chase. But I could not conceive such a thing at the time. Unhappily, his satchel had burst open in falling, and much of its contents almost certainly went into the lake. But Markito is a patient and thorough man, and what he brought back I am sure was all there was to be found &mdash; the Historian's notebook seemed to be intact, although its primitive binding was nearly gone; some leaves may have come loose from the beginning or the end &mdash; having read it through, I still cannot say. There was an ancient piece of treated hide that may have been used to wrap other items, but there was nothing in or upon it when it was found. In the trees and bushes Markito said there were scraps so very old that most disintegrated when he touched them. One or two of these he managed to retrieve, but the writing on them was very obscure, and after a few days in the open air they crumbled to dust....

	["Egderus at Mountain House","Here beginneth the Testament of Egderus, 9th Superius Frater of Mountain House, in the 50th season of his tenure. May he be shielded from illness and disaster, until it be completed. ... At that time Robenc was Phylax at Mountain House. Officially he commanded the stratioti of the garrison, but also he reported to the old Golias upon the doings of the Superius Frater. But the Superius was shrewd, where Robenc was young and rather naive... ... At first I found it hard to be away from my mother, whom I would never see again, and whose stories I told myself over and over at night in order to fall asleep. But the Superius took me under his wing, asking me to do things for him, treating me with kindness and asking my advice on many subjects, even though there could hardly be anything that I could teach him. Only once did I see him become perturbed about anything, and that was when Robenc came to Mountain House. The House had always been guarded by stratioti &mdash; soldiers &mdash; who lived in the outbuildings and patrolled the paths and roads. There were five stratioti and the Phylax, their commanding officer, and they kept watch in pairs in quarter-day shifts. The man who was Phylax when I first arrived was named Gig, and he terrified us all because of his fierce appearance and awful temper. Off duty he was often drunk, and sometimes chased the younger brothers with his axe. Gig never entered the House, so if we could prevent Gig from ever getting between us and the House, we could usually escape without much trouble. But Gig was sly as well as mean, and would sometimes surprise one of us out on a trail, and then a fearsome chase would ensue. To my knowledge he never caught anyone, though occasionally a slight injury was incurred in trying to get away from him. He never came after me, perhaps because I could not run, and so chasing me would give him no pleasure. But one day he did catch me out in the open. I was on my way to meet the Superius Frater, who had gone down the mountain to meet with the Golias. The Prior, who liked to be called The Good Doctor, sent me to make the hour's walk to the Gatehouse because, he said, he could spare no one else, and he was not going to spoil me like the Superius did. About halfway between the House and the Gate, the road drops off steeply on the left hand side while a rocky bank rises just as steeply on the right. Gig jumped out from behind an outcropping, roaring like a bear. In my terror I turned too quickly, my leg collapsed, and I tumbled onto my back. Gig loomed over me and raised his axe. Even if I had not been paralyzed with fright, I could never have escaped this giant man. But when he saw my face, he jumped back as if he himself were terrified. His axe clattered on the paving stones, and he looked as if he was going to run. I must have let out a cry or made some sound, for he came to himself, and grabbed up his axe, raising it again over me. I covered my face with my arms, certain that I was about to die. He grunted once, and I heard the axe whizz through the air. My ears began to ring like the inside of the bell tower, and sparkling golden light washed over me. I awoke on a cot in the infirmary. The Superius Frater himself was dozing on a chair beside me. He told me he had found me lying in the middle of the road on his way back from the town. When he asked me what had happened, for some reason I didn't want to tell him, at least not until I'd had a chance to ponder it for a while. So I pretended I could not remember anything since before he left for town that morning. After a day or so I was able to resume my duties, and it was then I learned that Gig had disappeared. The stratioti were more irritable than usual &mdash; each had to pull double-shifts to cover Gig's absence &mdash; but they also were frightening the younger brothers with stories of demons lurking in the woods. And of course the off-duty stratioti would want to hunt for Gig, and would press anyone they could into service. A week later poor Brother Anders found a limbless torso beside the Spring. He ran back to the House, his hair still on end, and told us what had happened: as he was filling the buckets, what he thought was a large rock hit the roof of the spring house, then bounced into the weeds beside the path. Curious, he had gone to look at it. I could not walk so far, so I did not see the scene which awaited the party of brothers and stratioti who returned to the Spring, but Brother Anders told me about it: a brief search of the woods turned up two arms without hands and two legs without feet; Anders was unfortunate enough to find Gig's head balanced on top of a boulder just off the path. He had never seen such an expression on a human face, he said, and never wanted to again. But more than that, he prayed that he would never have to see what that face was looking at. I never saw the head or the rest of the body, but I believe I had seen the look that Brother Anders described. And Gig was looking at me.   The new Phylax was named Robenc. He was tall and stern-looking, but after he had established his personal authority over the stratioti, he started speaking to the brothers, even smiling when one of us crossed his path. This caused considerable discussion at meals, for none of us, except on rare occcasions the Superius Frater, had been spoken to by the Phylax or the stratioti. Brother Anders received more attention from Robenc than had anyone else. Robenc asked him about the incident at the Spring, about how Gig behaved, about how the other men treated him, and particularly about Gig's habit of chasing younger brothers to scare them. One day the Superius Frater told me that Robenc wanted to see me. I was worried. He must have found out about my encounter with Gig on the road to the Gate; Anders was the only one I had told, and I had not told him about the look on Gig's face. So I hobbled around the end of the lake to the Council House, where Robenc shared quarters with the stratioti. When I scratched at the door, he himself let me in, and bade me sit down underneath the large window which overlooked the lake. 'You are Egderus, the Superius Frater's pet, are you not?' My answer came out before I could stop it. 'Pets are animals. I am a man. My name is Egderus.' Robenc's eyes opened wide, then he burst into laughter. 'I am rebuked by the man named Egderus!' he cried. 'Not yet a man by his stature, methinks, but the voice is almost changed.' He chuckled again. 'Now tell me, Man Egderus, are you not His High-and-Mightyship's secretary?' 'If by that taunting name you mean the Superius Frater,' I said, becoming angry, 'I do sometimes write down what he dictates to me.' 'And what makes you better than the others, that you get to stay in the house all day when they must toil in the fields in all weathers?' 'I am lame.' He frowned at me, and was silent for a time. 'Forgive me,' he finally said, in a voice quite different from before. 'We begin suspicious of each other. I make it worse. I am an ignorant brawler, to treat you so rudely; foolish also to act so high-handedly without first determining the character of the man to whom I speak. Your pardon, Brother Egderus.' I was so surprised I could only nod. 'The Superius believes I have been sent by the Golias to spy on him. My orders are to guard Mountain House, along with my men. We interfere as little as possible in the activities of this community, the purpose of which we do not understand. It is not necessary, fortunately, for a soldier to understand his orders, only to obey them.' He drew his chair closer. 'Brother Egderus, in order for me to carry out my duties, I must find out what happened to my predecessor, the man called Gig. You knew him, did you not?' 'We never spoke.' He leaned very close to my face. 'I have just asked and received your pardon for behaving foolishly toward you. Do not reverse our positions by evading my questions.' I swallowed, then nodded. He asked me about Gig's reputation, his drinking, his habit of chasing people out in the woods. Finally, he asked, 'Would you say that Gig was an intelligent man?' 'No.' 'Would you say... he was a good man?' 'No.' 'Would you say that Gig was a man who was easily frightened?' I thought for a moment. 'No.' 'You hesitate.' 'I did not know him well.' 'Right, you never go outside.' He was watching me closely. 'I did meet him once, on the road to the Gatehouse.' 'Ah?' He acted surprised, but he was not. 'Tell me.' I told him the story I had told Anders, again leaving out Gig's moment of terror. Robenc listened carefully, nodding. When I was finished, he regarded me for a long time. 'And who else knows?' 'I only told my cellmate, Brother Anders.' 'The one who found Gig's body?' 'Yes.' 'You know, of course, that this makes you the last person to see Phylax Gig alive?' I had not thought of that. I must have turned pale. 'Do you think your incident with Phylax Gig on the road to the Gatehouse is significant?' 'I think it may be.' 'Did you kill Phylax Gig?' I laughed out loud. 'I?' 'Do you know who did?' Now I was bewildered. 'Who?' 'Someone did,' Robenc said grimly. 'Someone who lives here.' 'But how could one of us do that &mdash; ?' 'Do what?' 'Tear off his arms and legs like that, drop them out of the sky &mdash; ?' He leaned toward me again. 'Something did that to him, it did not just happen. No wild beast dismembers its victim so cleanly, and then places the head on a boulder beside the trail to face the next person who comes along. Now go tell your Master I wish to see him.' He got up and left the room. I stumbled back to the House, entering through the refectory door on the lake side. I had seen someone in the window of the Superius Frater's study, so I went there right away. But the door was opened by the Prior, the one who liked to be called The Good Doctor. 'What were you doing in the Council House?' 'Phylax Robenc wished to speak to me.' 'Without my permission?' 'The Superius Frater &mdash; ' 'The Superius Frater is supposed to clear these things with me. Well?' he said, leaning towards me as if to strike. I started stammering, repeating what the Superius Frater had said to me. 'You should have come to me.' 'The Superius Frater said right away &mdash; ' I was almost in tears. The man could do that to me, any time, he was so snappish and impatient. 'Well? What did you tell him?' 'The Superius Frater?' 'No, halfwit! The Phylax!' 'I didn't tell him anything &mdash; ' 'Did you tell him about seeing Gig on the road?' 'Well, yes, but &mdash; ' This time he did strike me, a slap across the face. 'You fool! Now he'll think we are in a plot against him. Well, it's too late now. I will simply have to deny it, convince him you made it up to feel important.' 'I did not &mdash; ' 'Of course you did! Why did you not say something right away? You heard everyone else telling tales around the table, you had to have a tale yourself to tell about Gig.' 'But I didn't &mdash; ' 'And do not you dare bother the Superius Frater with this. I will handle it. You get back to the Scriptorium.' He pushed me out and slammed the door.   I could never determine who was the stronger, the Superius Frater or Phylax Robenc. They had no love for one another, and I thought I understood why: Robenc believed that it was a brother of the House, or a group of them, who had tortured and mutilated Gig, out of revenge for his having chased them with his axe. The Superius Frater appeared to be indifferent to the question of who killed Gig, whom he had regarded with distaste but ignored as best he could. But Robenc he seemed to fear, perhaps to hate, for a reason I could not fathom. The one time I tried to ask him about it, he glared me to silence. After my interview with Phylax Robenc, I had little opportunity to speak with the Superius Frater, mainly because the Good Doctor would not let me see him, and found tasks for me to do in the Scriptorium, which kept me out of the Superius Frater's sight. In any event, my Master became very preoccupied, and spent more and more time in his little study, doing what I could not imagine, watchfully guarded by the Prior, who set up a workspace for himself in the library off the refectory, all but blocking the Superius Frater's door. My time in the Scriptorium, however, did not go unrewarded. The project the Prior had set me to complete was to copy more than two dozen books from the library. This work would force me to stay at my desk as long as there was light, as he well knew, if I were to finish before Year's End, the day when my labors must be accomplished if I were not to be punished. It was not my habit to question orders given me by my superiors, but in this case I did have to wonder. The books he had given me to copy were the chronicles of the Old Kings, several Scriptures, the Songs, and a collection of miscellaneous writings &mdash; annals of Mountain House, receipts and accounts, inventories, even recipes from the kitchen! Stuck in the back of this hodgepodge of scribblings, I found some notes in the Superius Frater's hand...   And so I took my leave of Mountain House, and entered the service of the Good Doctor. Brother Anders wept to see me go, for he loved me well, but I was too stunned, I think, to feel much of anything except dread for the future. At a moment when the Good Doctor was busy supervising the gathering of his belongings (including the copies of ten books from the library that I had managed to finish), the Superius Frater secreted me into his study for a farewell interview. 'My son, I must apologize for not seeing as much of you lately as I would have liked, but the events of the past few months have been most distressing and have required my complete attention. There are so many things I want to tell you, but there is no time, and I dare not trust anything to writing &mdash; I think you understand what I mean. 'I wish you did not have to leave here at all; but the world you will be entering I hope you will find fascinating and not wholly evil. My advice to you is to trust no one your own heart tells you is untrue; better yet, trust no one at all. Humans will promise anything, and you will often wish to believe things do not work the way they do. The world your new masters will represent to you is not the only world; as you have already seen, life can change utterly in a moment. Believe what seems to your heart to be true, but be prepared to abandon that truth the instant it plays you false. 'We will most likely never meet again. I am old, and my enemies compass me round about, as the saying goes. I will think of you with great fondness, and with regret that I could not keep you with me. Should you ever return to Mountain House, I will make sure that whoever takes my place will have a gift for you. There, I have just made one of those promises I warned you about. 'The time has come. My blessing go with you.' He embraced me and then turned his back, to stare out his window over the lake.   Having been brought to Mountain House as a boy, the only thing I remembered about the world outside was what my mother told me in stories during the days when my leg was healing. And so it was with no little curiosity that I gazed about me as the wagon creaked and swayed along its way out of the Gate and started down the hill towards the town. Phylax Robenc had opened the barrier himself, staring at me fixedly as long as I remained in view. But then we went around a bend, and the trees closed the Gate out of sight, and we started downhill. We were already nearly an hour's slow ride from the House, and it would be nearly dusk before we reached the town, as the road wound back and forth across the face of the mountain in order to manage the descent. The Good Doctor had left before me at dawn, and my only companion on the trip was the driver, who let me know by his stolid silence that he had no wish to converse, so I was left alone with my thoughts for most of the day. I attempted to gather in my mind all the events that had taken place since the death of Phylax Gig, and to try to understand them. First: although I had always been in awe of the Superius Frater, it was clear to me now that his power was not absolute at the House. Phylax Robenc had told me to tell the Superius Frater that he wished to see him &mdash; an order, not a request. And the Superius Frater was unable to stop Phylax Gig from terrorizing the brothers &mdash; indeed, I did not remember his doing anything about it. So perhaps the Phylax and the stratioti were in some way not just the guardians of Mountain House, but also, in a way, our gaolers as well. And this meant that they had been placed over us by somebody, which further suggested that they must report on our doings to that someone from time to time. Second: the Superius Frater seemed not to have complete authority over the Prior either, or else I would certainly have been permitted to see the Superius more than just the once after my interview with Phylax Robenc. Indeed, from that moment the Superius Frater became almost completely isolated from all the brethren. This reclusiveness was unlike him. He always took meals with us, found a reason to speak to every brother almost every day; he regularly read the lessons and led us in the prayers &mdash; and even worked in the fields when the weather was fine and his official duties were not pressing. The Good Doctor had been with us for almost two years before the death of Phylax Gig. And never in all that time had he seemed more than a bad-tempered busybody who ordered everyone around, but whom no one &mdash; least of all the Superius Frater &mdash; took seriously. But with the appearance of Phylax Robenc, the Good Doctor quickly took charge of the situation, and the Superius seemed unable to do anything about it. So now it seemed to me that the Good Doctor had not transferred innocently from another chapter, as we had been told when he first appeared. He may have come from that chapter but he was placed at Mountain House in order to keep an eye on the Superius Frater. Again: by someone. Third: I began to think more about the man the Superius had been before he came to Mountain House &mdash; only a few years before I myself was donated to this community. He had not always belonged to our order, but in fact had led quite an active life in the court of the old Golias, as one of the older brothers told me. What brought about this drastic change in his life? Had he committed a crime? created a scandal? made a powerful enemy? No one knew, and no one had the courage to ask him. It was possible that he had simply tired of worldly life and wished to spend his last days in peace and contemplation. Were that the case, however, I do not believe he would have accepted the position of Superius Frater, at Mountain House or anywhere else. So I concluded that the Superius himself had been placed at Mountain House, not unlikely against his will, though there was nothing in his manner to indicate he was unhappy with his circumstances &mdash; that is, until the coming of Phylax Robenc. Finally: who was this Phylax Robenc? As Phylax his responsibilities were far from clear to me, and I could not tell what kind of man he was from just the one 'conversation' we had had. But he inspired apprehension, perhaps even fear, in the one living person I loved more than anyone in the world, and so either he or the one who sent him had a dreadful hold over the Superius Frater. What kind of hold could that be? I was determined, now that I was to enter the world where such power was generated, to find out.","EgderusatMountainHouse.html"],
	["Egderus' Last Writings","According to the Remnant, 'When you do not know where to turn, a step in any direction is progress.' When I began, I hoped I would be able to continue these recollections at leisure; there are many people who cared for and inspired me, and I would like to do proper honor to their memory. But my time is short. I must press on and finish this testament. My friend the Historian had been tortured for more than he knew, or let on that he knew. In his own mind, he was simply a braggart and a drunkard who had opened his mouth once too often. But even he must have wondered at the avidity of the Good Doctor's attentions &mdash; what evil did the Good Doctor believe he was rooting out? Of course he never explained it to me, and the interrogation was cut short by the Historian's escape before the Good Doctor could get what he was after. But I have meditated on this mystery over the long years, and &mdash; putting this incident together with others that have taken place since &mdash; I have come to a provisional explanation. I do not know what the Historian's actual convictions were concerning the Ancients, but the Good Doctor without question was convinced he was a heretic. Almost all of the clients of the Office of Inquiry were being held for some impious act or statement &mdash; and at the time the penalty for false belief was death, once the Examiner had persuaded the client to confess. The Good Doctor would never himself have bothered with a simple case of impiety. And no one would have believed the Historian's assertion to be a childhood friend of the Golias, so it is doubtful that it was this claim that made him important to the Good Doctor. By the time the Good Doctor took over the interrogation, the issue had ceased to come up &mdash; the Historian attempted to invoke this alleged friendship early on, but apparently gave up, seeing that it had no effect. There had been rumors about an unlawful Fellowship that preached an outrageous doctrine concerning the Ancients: that they were not gods at all, but rather plain human beings like us: people, not deities, who had mysteriously destroyed themselves, and that our puny towns and fortresses are built upon &mdash; indeed, fashioned from &mdash; the residuum of their unimaginably glorious but wholly mortal civilization. Reportedly the motto or creed of this apostate cult consisted of seven syllables in a strange language: sub-ob-scu-ram-er-at-lux, which was supposed to mean 'beneath darkness, there was light' or some such absurdity. No one I knew believed that there ever was such a Fellowship; the more cynical among the scriptores proposed that the whole story was concocted by the Examiners, as an embellishment on the cruelty that gave meaning to their lives. Or so I thought at the time, and for long afterwards. In my youthful affections, the Good Doctor was simply evil, and my beautiful Historian his entirely innocent victim. I do not remember encountering the nonsense phrase in my readings of his previous sessions with other Examiners', but then I wasn't looking for it; most likely he never uttered it, because he had never heard of it. But I now believe that my master was convinced that the Historian was a bona fide apostle of this Fellowship, and the purpose of the interrogation was to get what the Good Doctor imagined was real information on its activities and the whereabouts of more false prophets like him. I repeat that I do not know if the Historian was in fact a member of this Fellowship, if it existed at all. And the Good Doctor never found out, at least not from the Historian. Of my own convictions in the matter, I may say more later, if there is time. The Good Doctor himself disappeared, under circumstances that remain unclear to me. I am fairly certain that my being returned to Mountain House was an indirect consequence of the purge which the Golias subsequently effected upon the Office of Inquiry. The Remnant say, 'The evil of today is tomorrow's good fortune,' and my life gives proof to the saying. And to its companion adage as well: 'Today's joy will break your heart tomorrow.' For my dear Historian repaid my helping him escape by getting himself killed coming back to me so many years later. And his death in my arms proved to be only the beginning of my heart's agony. Why O why did he steal his benefactors' treasure? For what possible benefit could he hope to exchange it? Surely he must have known they would come after him to get it back? And that this would result in their utter extinction, after so many generations, these children of the Ancients themselves? I cannot understand what he was thinking. What I am capable of understanding is that he may not have been thinking at all, that once he realized how precious the box was he simply snatched it and ran &mdash; he had no plan, not even a motive. That is how we are. I must believe that this is what happened: it simply happened. As the Remnant say, 'To question too deeply is to find the evil you fear'. The carnage that ensued is completely documented in the annals of the Golias, and I am thankful that I need not recapitulate it here. But once again, the evil of that day became the good fortune of another: at Mountain House we tended the wounded and eased the dying out of this life; afterwards I persuaded the Golias to let me continue this service to the hopelessly afflicted from all places. It has provided a purpose for an otherwise empty life. Yet I remain uneasy in spirit. My heart will never cease to grieve for those meaninglessly slain: my mentor the Superius Frater, my Historian, his benefactors, the soldiers of the Golias who were murdered for following their orders to murder. I was responsible for setting this evil in motion, though I cannot imagine doing other than I did, given what I knew, what I could not have known, what my own pride had not yet been sufficiently broken to permit me to learn. I accomplished my imagined revenge upon the Good Doctor, and weep when I remember Aric's attempt to warn me of its consequences. Now my recompense is near. I open my arms to its cold embrace....","EgderusLastWritings.html"],
	["Egderus' Secret","I am placing this here, among so many old documents, so that only the most persistent stalker may find it. Not even my secretary Markito knows of its existence, though once I am gone nothing can keep it safe but its own stillness and the busy neglect of my successors. I am violating my oath to even commit this small confession to writing, but I also cannot bear the thought that no one will know this heartbreaking truth: I have proof that we descend. When I was donated to Mountain House, I took the same pledge of the Order that all its members do. I was a boy at the time, but after I had become a man I still saw no reason to question orthodox doctrine concerning the Ancients, even after my extensive exposure to heresy in the Office of Inquiry. If I thought about the matter at all, I concluded that heretics were simply persons who had gone off their heads somehow, and if I disagreed with the way they were treated, it was only because I pitied them and despised their tormentors, not because I agreed with any of their mad beliefs. Even the experience with the Historian did not change the essential confidence I had in the picture of the world that had been taught me: The Ancients were the gods of the old dispensation, who fashioned the world out of nothing and ruled it for a time, until the final battle with their enemies in which all creation was destroyed. As the old hymn has it: A great Wolf pursues the sun Three years across the packed snow, Three years from autumn to spring. At last she is caught: The huge jaws close and crush her, Swallowing her light. The gods quarrel and fall out: No daughter is safe, no son survives. The fiends and demons burst their prison The great Snake leaps from the sea, Spewing poison over the land. The sky explodes, the earth sinks. Fire and steam attack each other. The stars fall from their watch-posts. At last all goes under, and a mighty Wind Scatters the smoke into the Void. In the Silence, a new earth Emerges from the deep, shining, joyous, cleansed. In the heavens, a new sun, More glorious than her mother, Begins her journey. After the inquest, when I was banished to Mountain House, it became a kind of blessing no one could have foreseen. In the first place, I was still desolated by the loss of my only love, and my grief had just been redoubled by the death of my mentor, the Eighth Superius Frater, now my predecessor. Many of the brothers remembered me, and most were very kind and helpful in getting me accustomed to my new duties as Superius Frater. The narrative of my early adventures in leadership may be found elsewhere. But eventually I more or less grew to fill my new position, and no longer was required to spend the greater part of each day trying to remember or even decipher what would need to be done the day following. And then, after many years, I recalled that my dear predecessor had promised to leave some kind of present for me, and set out to try to find it. I had already gone through his official writings many times, but unless he had left me a message in some kind of code, I found nothing that looked like a clue about a gift left for me. And then I remembered a curious old description of the House itself, finding in it features that were strange to me. What I could not recall was where nor even when I had seen this old fragmentary writing last, perhaps not even since my last sojourn at Mountain House, when I was still a boy. And this nudged my memory sufficiently to put me on the right track. In the old library, on the very shelf where I had left them so many years ago, were some of the books the Good Doctor had sentenced me to copy as punishment for my imagined misbehavior in the Gig affair. Among them was the collection of miscellaneous writings in which I had found the Superius Frater's sketches of various residents of the House. Only four of these notes were left &mdash; my guess was that someone else had discovered them and removed the ones most closely concerning himself and his friends. But I had to wonder why they were even there at all: could not the Superius Frater find a more secure hiding place than a book on an open shelf in the library? Perhaps he had meant these notes to be found, and by someone other than myself? Or maybe it was not the notes that were important &mdash; they seemed harmless enough &mdash; but rather the hiding place itself? So I began to inspect the book more closely, and to think that it must contain the clue I was looking for. It was a volume made by stitching together at least three separate books, with other odd signatures and even single pages sewn in here and there. There was no way to discern who had compiled the miscellany, nor even the authors of its constituent parts. Some of its contents must have been in the House from the earliest days of its existence. But my present concern was using it to help me find something else, not to delve into its own no doubt fascinating history, a temptation that was difficult to resist. Indeed, as I pored over the tattered compilation by daylight and moonlight, I lost track of what had caused me to seek it out in the first place: the description of the House. One night I fell asleep at my desk, my head resting on the very page I was looking for. When little Markito came to me the next morning, his touch on my shoulder startled me out of a dream I had had many times before, in which I wandered without light or hope through a maze of rock-walled chambers. The first thing I saw was the book on my desk, open to a crude drawing of the floor plan of the House on the page facing the description I sought. I stared at it until my vision cleared, and then began to read the familiar words again, only this time with fresh eyes, and to make a detailed comparison between the description, the drawing, and what I knew the actual structure of the House to be. Over the following days I inspected the House more closely, whenever I could find the time. For some reason I was reluctant to let anyone know what I was doing, and so took with me no one but the boy Markito, who had completely won my trust by his cheerful demeanor and utter devotion to me. I realize I must have appealed to my mentor in somewhat the same way, and see much of my younger self in the little foundling, perhaps more than is wise, considering what we were about to discover. But Markito has never once given me the slightest unease about his loyalty, and at this late time of my life I can do nothing other than to depend on him utterly. One sentence in the description continued to baffle me. It described a cellar beneath the entryway which 'could only be reached by an ill-kept and rickety stairway hidden beneath a heavy table' in what it called the Frater's library or study. Try as we might, neither Markito nor I could locate this hidden stairway, and from outside the house there was no evidence that such a cellar even existed. We concluded that if there was such a secret stairway, it must have been covered over by new flooring at some point after the description was written. It was Markito who first noticed what instantly struck me as the most significant aspect of the passage, once it was pointed out: not only was the writing itself in an antique script, but it was cast in the past tense, as if the description were of an arrangement of the house that was no longer in effect when it was written. We immediately went back to the drawing, and realized that it corresponded not to the description, but rather to some intermediate stage in the construction of the House. Markito made a new drawing, after pacing off the dimensions of the present plan of the House, in which he was able to show how some walls had been torn down and others erected or moved to create the arrangement of rooms as they are now. At this point we began our inspection anew, and soon discovered evidence of numerous changes in the layout of the House, once we knew what to look for. At last we found what had to be the spot, but there was no way to rip up the floor without incurring the curiosity of the rest of the brothers. However, Markito devised a way to get into the wall of my study, and by following a crawl space verified that there had once been a staircase just there, though it had long ago collapsed. In the next few days he also contrived a way to get down there himself, though the passageway was too small for a grown person to negotiate. I had him bring me anything that he could fit through his narrow tunnel, and soon I had a collection of objects that astounded and mystified me. I prepared an inventory, cataloguing everything that he brought me, and we kept the objects and the catalogue in the vault behind my desk. But he also told me of room upon room of what looked to him like large and small mechanical parts belonging to what we surmised to be a vast waterworks or mill of some kind, and I knew I would have to get down there somehow, without in any way alerting the others that our secret search for my predecessor's gift had finally been rewarded. Needless to say, this was not easy, but at last I gazed upon what I have since come to regard as the Treasure of the Ancients....","EgderusSecret.html"],

	["fire","In the middle of the night a huge explosion pitched me out of my cot onto the floor. I crawled to the window, and saw a fireball boiling away into the black sky, and as its glare faded it appeared that every house on the opposite slope had been blown apart: boards and bricks were still arcing through the air. Presently it was dark again; the only sound came from dim echoes off the mountains in the distance and the soft patter of debris landing across the way. Then flames sprang up in the wreckage, and in an instant the whole hillside was ablaze. It was an attack; what else could it be? I grabbed my kit hanging beside the door and leaped down the stairs, intending to scramble up the street behind me and so away. But turning the corner, I was nearly trampled by a pack of people running the other direction, toward the fire, and then the smoke was among us, and I lost my bearings. They shouted to each other, but not like a mob in panic: I realized this was a rescue team, and, in their ragged formation, they drove me along with them. More yelling now came from either side, and up ahead we could hear screams and the long wail of sudden certain grief. A glow appeared in the smoke and we turned that way, soon feeling its heat, which increased shockingly with every step, until we reached a wall, where my companions began to space themselves along its length. An implement on a pole was put into my hands, and someone directed me with gestures to dig and beat the fire at the wall's base and try to break it up. Then he disappeared into the smoke. I could see nothing but flames sheeting up the blank wall before me; I swatted at it with my stick, which turned out to be a kind of shovel, but this only fanned a smoldering mass at my feet, so I stabbed into that with the blade and managed to scatter whatever was burning there. But then the blade stuck under the wall, and I lost my hold on the haft and staggered backwards, my forgotten kit-bag swinging around and hitting me in the face. This sat me down hard on the ground, and suddenly I was dead calm. My next step would determine my fate: I knew I should run back the way I'd come, but I could feel on my shoulders that the fire had gotten behind me, and in any case I was no longer sure what direction 'back' actually was. The pole was still waggling in front of me, and without thought I seized it again, leaned my weight down on it, and felt the wall give slightly. I then wrenched the stick from side to side, and soon it came out, bringing with it a lump of the wall, so I attacked the little opening, striking at it again and again with the point of the spade, each time loosening enough plaster that I could see the old bricks it had covered. I widened the space at the base of the wall, scraping the ground away underneath, and finally, in a rage, struck the wall itself over and over with the back of the blade. Several hard blows were enough to knock most of the remaining stucco away. I then went after the lowest bricks with the shovel's point. One or two of them fell into the hole and I pulled them away, pounding and stabbing again and again just above the opening, which was now almost large enough for a child to crawl through. Suddenly I saw a hand reaching under the wall from the other side, grabbing at the bricks and trying to pull them loose. I now struck at the wall above that even harder, and a crack gradually zig-zagged up the mortar between the bricks. And then the hand below pulled one of the bricks free, and the wall simply fell out around me. I was face to face with a young man, who still held the loose brick in one hand. We crouched there, frozen, until he gently reached out with his free hand and touched my face. I stood up abruptly, and he did the same; then we looked at the blood on his fingers, and I realized my nose was bleeding. I seized his hand to pull him out of the building, but he jerked it away, whirling back into the darkness behind him. I was about to bolt in the other direction when he returned with a bundle in his arms. I looked along what was left of the wall on either side, unsure which way to go; he pushed past me, jerking his head for me to follow, then ran off into the murk. I started after him, but someone clapped my shoulder from behind, pulling me away from the opening and further along the wall, where we joined in fighting another blaze, then another, then another.   The light came up, the smoke began to thin, and by midmorning the fire was all but extinguished. By then the company of rescuers were congregating at the last place flames could be detected, laughing and pushing each other playfully as they recounted their several adventures. No attack had taken place, it seemed; the explosion was just some horrible accident. I sensed the moment coming when my companions would remember the stranger among them and turn to find out more about me, so I took my first chance to slip off and return to my room, if it was still there...","fire.html"],
	["First Sermon of Egderus","My friends, listen to me. We are always surprised when we meet one another, when we say something and find ourselves understood, because from our earliest days we were taught that we are no different from the others, that no person is better than any other. But we are not the same as others, we are different from most of the people we meet, for they do not understand what we say, even though they say that they do, and it is clear that they believe what they say. We have spent most of our lives alone among such people, and we adopt strategies for coping with the discrepancy between what we understand and what the others plainly do not. We say to ourselves that we must be missing something, and to try to figure out what it is we do not see that causes this misunderstanding. We try to explain ourselves, in order to help the others to see not just what we see, but what is there, and they become offended by what they call our condescending tone. We then assume we must be wrong, since everyone else disagrees, and we lose our courage, our spirit breaks, and misery and despair follow. Then one day we meet one who does understand, and we are staggered. We recognize each other, and love one another on the instant, and bind ourselves to one another forever; but beyond that we do not know what to do. For the world is in the power of the others, and this new confirmation is dangerous, for the others hate those different from themselves, and their hatred and wrath is terrible. But our power is not the power of force, which is their power; our knowledge is not the knowledge of indoctrination, which is their knowledge, it is the wisdom of experience; our understanding is not the cunning of the predator, which is their understanding, it is the vision of the seer. They are jealous and spiteful, we are generous and kind; they are vanglorious and selfish, we are modest and compassionate; they are wrong, we are right. They own the world, we are the bearers of life.","FirstSermonofEgderus.html"],
	["flight","We won't be traveling today: there's some concern, it seems, about crossing the open moor in daylight; but supplies are short, and we cannot stay here long. At least here there is water and a few edible berries, but of game there is none except small snakes and bugs, and the odd newt in the scrub near the brackish little stream. Were I alone, I would strike straight into the moor, for the mountains on the other side are forested, which promises better hunting. I judge it would take me three days to get there, even without food, so long as I had a swallow or two of water. And I might do just that, if my companions can't come to a reasonable decision, which is proving difficult. In my mind there are two alternatives to crossing the moor: return to the denser woods we left behind yesterday, where we can at least gather food and water for a longer journey, or else follow this little stream, in the hope that it leads to better country. Well, there is nothing for it but to wait while the men resolve what to do. The grandmother is wise enough to know she is not welcome in this wrangling, for this is as much about her son's leadership as about which way to set off &mdash; it's tiresome, of course, but I suppose there is some benefit to clearing the air: our case is serious, if not yet desperate; in such a situation, it's best for the men to settle where they stand with each other, and the time for doing that seems to be here. I, the stranger, have something to do with this. Our leader values my presence, and wants me to take part in the deciding, whereas some of the others remain suspicious of me, and one &mdash; no mistaking it &mdash; wants me gone. I can see Leader wishes to reason with this man, but that is not the way to deal with such a person: every argument made in my favor my opposer interprets as putting him in the wrong, which only makes him dig in deeper, and his temper is rising. Obviously I cannot speak for myself, so I stay out of the way as best I can. Grandmother pretends not to care what they are arguing about, but she is following the debate with some anxiety: her face betrays nothing, but she is never out of earshot &mdash; though of course once the men start shouting, everyone can hear. My antagonist is on the verge of an open challenge. But I begin to see that Leader has inherited some of his mother's cunning: he's deliberately drawing his opponent closer to that line, trying to get him to cross it sooner than the man wants to, before support has solidified behind him. But this is wiliness, not wisdom, and the young leader himself is approaching a line he must never cross, that of publicly disrespecting his rival, who will never forgive that, and then there will be no peace until one or the other is gone for good or dead.   At the very moment I realized this, Grandmother looked at me. Without further thought I charged into the circle, pushed the contenders apart, and, shaking my finger in their faces, scolded them for exactly what they were doing. I did not need them to understand my words: I only had to break up the momentum building between them by drawing their anger towards me. Sad how easy this was to accomplish; instantly they both turned on me, and together drove me from the circle. This of course imperiled my position in the group, but by that time my feigned wrath had turned real, and I wanted to be done with them all... =====[lacuna]=====   I was gone for only half a day before I regretted leaving and turned back; the rage that impelled me to desert my friends evaporated quickly out on the moor, in its empty vastness and pitiless wind. By then I had lost my sense of where the camp was, and wandered haphazardly until nightfall, when I finally perceived what looked like a campfire on the horizon and headed that way as quickly as I could. It was in fact a fire, but much larger than I thought at first, and so further away; as I got nearer I saw a whole group of trees ablaze, and then, even closer, charred bodies in among the flames. Whatever I hoped or could think of, there was nothing I could do but sit out on the moor and watch the fire grow, the whole rest of the night. An hour before dawn it began to rain, and by the time it was light the fire had died down enough so that I could begin to move in, a few steps at a time. As I got closer, I peered at the blackened lumps on the ground: the children were easy to pick out, of course; I could also tell some females from males, but would never be able to tell who any one of them was. When I could, I counted them. Two were missing. I paced around what was once the whole extent of the camp, looking everywhere inside and out, but could not find any others &mdash; perhaps, I hoped, these two had escaped, and I started searching for tracks. But then a far worse thought came to me: they'd been taken captive. All this time I'd been telling myself that the fire was a terrible accident, but now I finally had to face the near certainty that this had been done deliberately: the bodies were all within the perimeter, except for the two missing, which meant that my friends were already dead before the trees began to burn. The attack on the town had never been about the town: it was about me. After seizing it, my pursuers searched for me without success; they found our trail and followed; they had overrun our camp only a few hours before. Missing me again, they slaughtered everyone and set the grove on fire. It was a message.   I am now without companions. My last was a wood thrush, who in the dusk this morning sang me awake, from a swaying forked branch above where I lay, just outside the line of the burning. I watched as he hopped from spot to spot, circling what he must have judged to be a good nesting place, for shortly he was joined by a silent female. He fidgeted nearby as she inspected the site, then, apparently approving his choice, she came and went with twig, straw, and fuzz, beginning to build while he fluted encouragement. When I stirred they fled, but once I was up and had cinched my pack, I stood still for many moments, reluctant to leave, and he returned to urge me on, his black eye a glint in the rising light. As I hiked out into the emptiness of the moor, his melancholy song followed me a long time, stroking my sorrow but warning against hope, until I could no longer tell if that bittersweet strain came from the distance or from within. I cannot stop weeping. After all this time, and everything that has happened, the cause of my grief seems to be life itself.   Another bird dwells out here on the moor: an hour before dawn, it utters a rapid 'wit-wit-wit-wit-wit!' only once, and then is silent, until, just as the sky begins to lighten, he repeats it, again, only once &mdash; 'wit-wit-wit-wit-wit!' &mdash; and I know the long empty night is over. His first utterance wakes me; when he sings again, I rise and set off. I thought I would be across the moor in three days, but it is now the fifth day since I left the burnt-out camp, and the mountains seem no closer. It has been hard to keep my bearings in this monotonous terrain, but there is one peak I'm aiming for, and I strive to keep the sun's path, insofar as I can estimate it from hour to hour, on a consistent angle with my own. But the past two days it has rained steadily, and neither mountain nor sun can be seen.   Some time now since food ran out. Caught a lizard; added a few purple berries and a mouthful of rainwater from a pool in a rock. The sky has cleared, the mist lifted; the mountains are no nearer. Death has the reach of me now: I feel less fear than I'd have thought. Had I stayed with my friends, there'd be one more charred hump among the trees. No: I'd be in chains or worse &mdash; well, no point imagining that. Another damn message.","flight.html"],
	["fog","The sun dawned bright behind me, illumining the little town where I'm hiding out: through my widow, I watch the shadow of the slope I sit on shrink down the face of the hill opposite, heading for the spring that trickles between us. But fog is boiling up from the lake on the other side, threatening to swallow the homes and outbuildings over there. So: a life. Or part of one, anyone's, at any given time, this fleeting refuge between flight and flight... The fog is winning, and the sunlit walls on the houses snugged up against their mountain have begun to pale, as if taken ill. The fog may engulf us all, but that will not stop the roosters, or the dogs, or the echoes of footfalls going up then down the crooked lane below me as the day grows on. My neighbors' generations all live their life here. I see them in the square, walking arm in arm, four across: each with different hair or hat, but under that, the same face at different ages. A lovely place to live, and because of this, perhaps, everyone is generous and friendly, apparently unbothered by my strange appearance and incomprehension of their speech. But even the children here smile to me, and if any are shy at first, they are soon reassured by the others, who think me harmless. I am not harmless. I should be able to get out, if need be, before my pursuers find this blessed place &mdash; or so I tell myself, when the thought of those terrible entities strangles my will to flee yet farther. But not yet. The water-wagon creaks by, far below, the old driver with no voice beating his wooden bell, setting the pace for his ancient mule, toc-toc, toc-toc, toc-toc, lulling my silly heart into the same placid rhythm. Only two roosters contesting now, yelling 'O be quiet, you!' like boys in the schoolyard, and one dog woofs sleepily, trying to remember what set him off not long ago. A big-eyed cat picks her nervous way along the roof tiles, leaps a chest-high wall, then vanishes under a ragged tarp. I know that kind of running. No wind: the clothes strung along the same rooftop hang straight down like dead men &mdash; the way I will hang, like as not right soon, as my mother would have put it. She too was a stranger in that land, far away now, where she brought me into this life; however that came to be, she told no name nor laid no blame (another of her sayings), but you don't have to live long in this world to understand the ways a child comes to have only one parent, or none. With her I needed no father to teach me to fight, and what to be willing to do to win, and how winning turns to disgust the next moment, a stain going cold on the stones. Ach, I miss her so. She was my champion, and she required that I be hers as well, even when I was small, training me to it finely: waste no rage on fools, but make them pay respect, to her, to me, and to themselves, if that can be managed. At the last she was an elder of our village, grandmother to the whole town, and when she died every last soul mourned, the dogs howling. I inherited her courage, her cussedness, and some measure of her cunning, but not, in the end, her gift of command. Not for me, it turns out, the life with others, the helping, the healing, the patience &mdash; nor, in fine, the love. With one exception, but I won't speak of that. Not yet. If ever. The fog was drawing back a moment ago, but now it once more pushes down the hillside towards me, a host on the march. Chills the bones, withers the heart, does the fog, but it will hide me from my foes another hour yet.","fog.html"],

You read a few of those on top, or read at them, just to see what they are about, and begin to wonder how they might be connected: sometimes you perceive a link here and there &mdash; a name appears in more than one writing, maybe, or now and then some dates seem to line up &mdash; but most of the individual texts are just that: singletons that don't relate to each other at all, or not that you can see, so far... But, you reflect, they all ended up here, together like this; how did that happen? because of course every writing has another story in addition to the one it tells: how did it get from the author to you? Tracing that second story back to its source, you realize that of course there's a third story to be discovered, or discerned: how did this document come to be composed in the first place? how does it fit in with the story of the author's life? And so on: as the Remnant say, no end of stories and their stories. One of the many pleasures of exploring an archive takes place at the very beginning, before you have any comprehension of its overall structure or extent. In that moment, every new thing you discover is itself alone, you know nothing about it to begin with except what it says about itself, you don't know where to go when you finish reading it, but it feels like every step you take, in whatever direction, is progress. After a while, an impression of context begins to emerge: you now perceive a writing as being in among other writings, whose only connection at first was that you were reading them, but you start to feel them talking to each other, if only in your recollection of them, so you go back and reread this one, then that one &mdash; and you start to perceive structure as well as content, how they resemble each other, or differ in this or that respect. At this point the pure experience which Egderus describes as reading 'something bright and right and beautiful for the first time' gives over, more and more, to the forensic activities of the investigator, which of course have their own pleasures, but they are quite distinct. One gets to know a person in just this way, is it not so? And so, you are invited into the company of just these persons, whose writings address you, whom they imagined, and longed for enough to tell just these stories, in just this way, and for whom they have waited until now, when you appeared, just as they hoped you would.

	["grandmother","Very early this morning, after a restless night, I went out and sat apart from the group, watching the stars fade as I had loved to do in my attic room in the town. In a while, the grandmother came out of the scraggly thicket where the rest were still sleeping, and sat, not close, but a little beyond arm's reach, like a stranger at an otherwise empty café, near enough to start a conversation, if one of us wanted to, but far enough that it wouldn't be necessary, if neither of us did. We faced west, watching the distant hills begin to stand out from the black sky, a few thready clouds lazing near their tops as they pinked up, as if coming back from the dead. In a moment, sunlight began to melt like honey down the mountain's flank. Presently I heard what I thought was wind moving across the moor before us, but then realized she was humming, and out of the corner of my eye I perceived that she rocked, like someone mourning. The sound and motion penetrated me, and I began rocking as well, the grief for all I've lost forever rising powerfully in me, but I forced it back down with an impatient gesture, and she instantly went silent and still. I felt she had turned, and when I looked, I saw her regarding me, head tipped to the side, with what might have been a small smile. She nodded once, then turned her gaze back toward the brightening mountains. She rocked a few more times, then looked down and spoke gently. Of course I did not comprehend all she said, but I recognized the word that I think means 'outlander' &mdash; the word they use for me &mdash; though she seemed to be applying it to herself, or using it in a way that didn't involve me. Perhaps she too had been a foreigner among these people at one time &mdash; but then sooner or later all of us find ourselves a stranger among strangers, do we not? Whatever she was saying, it was a story, as I recognized, and I nodded or murmured when the music of her telling invited me to do so, and when the tale was over, and she looked up to see if I understood, I smiled, because I did understand, if not her text, then the feeling she imparted in conveying it to me &mdash; the weight of its meaning, if not the meaning itself, and she saw she had reached me, and smiled in return. The others were stirring; she looked towards them, then got up and, as she passed, put a hand on my shoulder &mdash; I couldn't tell whether she wanted me to stay behind because she did not want us seen together, or was only telling me I could keep my watch a little longer if I wished, so I remained in place, returning my gaze to the now brilliant landscape, feeling all at once at peace, a creature in a world again.","grandmother.html"],

Fear stabbed through me: suddenly I was a hapless schoolchild again. I spread my own hands as if to say, who knows? He looked at me, then smiled gently, returning his gaze to the fire. There was a long silence. 'When I was a boy,' he began, so softly I had to lean closer to hear him, 'my master posed that problem to me &mdash; for it is a problem, yes? Discerning the purpose of things? Is not the first act of the newly born infant, even as it howls in horror, to open and close its tiny hands, reaching, reaching, deeper and deeper into this world, until at last it grips the giant index of the the midwife? So we begin; so also we end, do we not? clutching at this world with all our failing strength, while all comfort, all peace, all wisdom, all joy, are pried from our grasp, finger by finger.' He sat back with a huffing laugh. 'Forgive me. I did not come here to weary you with my broodings, but to bear you company.' I murmured my thanks. 'I have been mulling this old lesson of my master, which has returned after so many years.' He paused, considering something. 'Last night I dreamed I was a fish, swimming with my brethren and companions through the vast, boundless ocean. No roof over our heads, no walls on any side, no ground beneath our feet &mdash; no feet! Neither had we hands. No tools, no weapons. No records. No history.' He cocked an eye at me. 'No artifacts, neither.' I smiled. 'No law, no crime, no punishment,' he went on, enjoying himself now. 'No armies, no government, no institutions to join or be kept out of.' Or banished from, I couldn't help but add. 'Yes!' he cried, clapping my forearm. 'No oaths of allegiance, no excommunications, no vows, no promises &mdash; ' No text, I blurted, surprising us both. He looked at me a long moment, then his eyes set. 'Indeed,' he said, turning back to the fire. Then, almost in a whisper, 'No ghosts'. We said nothing more after that...","hands.html"],

	["Historian's Notebook","... Their language is beautiful, like bird-calls almost, but very quiet most of the time. When they must hail each other over a distance, they do sound like birds or insects, or else they make other non-human sounds: water dripping in a pool, wind blowing through the pines and oaks, a rock coming loose and bounding down a slope. I don't know how long I've been with them &mdash; the last thing I remember is a late spring snowstorm, and now it is early autumn. I must have fallen, judging from the new crook in my leg, and the pain it causes me when I try to walk. Well, one doesn't exactly walk in this terrain, one scrambles. It's a vertical life. Luckily my arms are strong, and my thumbs have healed completely. They have begun to leave me by myself for a day or so at a time, so I explore my prison. Actually, I only call it that &mdash; there are no iron doors, no locks, no night guards who like touching up the Bone-Snapper's work after everyone's asleep, or pretending to be. A young female used to be left with me, a kind of nurse who fed me and helped me exercise my leg. She didn't seem happy with the assignment, if I can judge from her peculiar little face, which bore no expression I could read except extreme alertness. She rarely turned her eyes on me, but when she did, it was chilling &mdash; interest without feeling. I had no doubt she could have dispatched me as easily as a cat kills a moth that wanders into the room. They do remind me of cats in a way &mdash; they're so agile among the rocks and tree limbs &mdash; and they can sit perfectly still and silent for long periods of time. They don't speak often, but when they do, they bring their faces very close together and murmur, accompanying this musical speech with astonishing expressions and gestures that incorporate the whole body. It's downright arousing to watch two of them doing this, and the others, if there are more than just the two present, seem equally rapt by this performance. It may last only a few moments, or go on for an hour or more, but it always seems to break off abruptly, when one of them simply turns and moves away.   One mystery among many is this notebook and stylus. In every other way, my hosts seem so primitive, so aboriginal, that even their owning such tools is amazing. But when these objects were first put into my hands, my benefactor made gestures that clearly indicated that I was to write something, if I knew how. Once he saw that I could hold the things properly, however, he went away. In fact, none of them has showed any interest at all in what I am writing here, which makes me think I may not be the first wayfarer to have dropped in on them &mdash; as I did, literally. Tired now, and my leg is aching. They have a lovely potion for pain &mdash; one seems to float upward on billows of warm light. I imagine dying to be like that, though I'm probably wrong...   Something is happening: we are on the move. Last night for the first time I saw the whole band together in one place, the large 'hall' near the lower crevice. Nurse had summoned me with three sharp cries right in my face. I was so stunned that I followed her without thinking. Only now, as I write this in predawn twilight, do I realize that it is the first time any of them has spoken to me directly. That is, with the voice. Until last night what communication I have had with them has been only through signs and gestures. Everyone is awake now; we are moving out.   This notebook is fascinating to me. I cannot tell what the pages are made of &mdash; skin? bark? &mdash; but, stiff and rumpled though they are, they have one property that makes them perfect for the conditions in which we live: one has only to scratch on the page with the stylus to make a legible mark &mdash; no ink is necessary. I have also been given a pebble of some chalky substance that can be rubbed on the page to erase the marks I have made. I'm not sure how this works, and the erasure is in some ways worse than the mistake it was supposed to remove. The chalky substance makes the page stick to the back of the one on top of it when I close the book, and at least one page I have written simply cannot be pried loose any more. But why do they want me to write in this notebook? When they first gave it to me, back in the Rock Rooms (as I call that warren of roofless caves where I first found myself among them), if one of them happened to come upon me while I was writing, he would turn quickly away, as if not wishing to interrupt me at important work, or &mdash; now that I think about it more precisely &mdash; as one backs away from a feeding cat, so as not to frighten it away from its own food. Now, since we came to this place for the winter, they seem to regard my writing with indulgence, as if I am a good little boy playing quietly in the corner. But still none has come close to see what I am actually writing here. I do not understand it. However that may be, I am thankful for the diversion. Unlike my hosts, I am unable to sit utterly still and silent for hours, and if I don't work my leg from time to time it seizes up entirely. I can hardly describe how very difficult it was for me to make this move to winter quarters &mdash; I had felt pain before, but never like that, not even under the Bone-Snapper's expert hand. And there is no despair like total exhaustion. Nevertheless, I made it, and am now relatively comfortable in my little nook in this cave in the mountains, in the company of a dozen other souls about whom I know absolutely nothing that makes any sense. Unless I was transported by these folk a long distance from where I fell &mdash; and only a vague feeling tells me this is not the case &mdash; we must be somewhere in the mountains I was trying to get through in my attempted escape. I have no idea if there is any civilization (meaning, I suppose, a gathering of people like me) close by, but once again, I have a feeling there is. In winter quarters there isn't much to else for me to do except to wonder who these people are. We all stay together in the main part of the cave most of the time, so I have the opportunity to observe my hosts at leisure. Our life is primitive with respect to the necessities of life, but the social life is quite complex. There does not seem to be any leader per se, and yet when there is something to be done, all act as one. Or rather, each takes part in a perfectly coordinated effort that is rather like a single body's various members performing different but equally important actions to complete a single but complicated task &mdash; say, break camp and move to winter quarters (and bring the clumsy stranger along). They wear garments that cover the entire body and head, with a flap to cover the mouth and nose when it's very cold. A few of the older ones also wear a peculiar kind of visor that shields their eyes from the light, to which they seem extraordinarily sensitive. In fact, this piece of equipment is a kind of badge of seniority, if I am correctly reading the way these elders are treated by the others. I do not think they ever take these garments off, let alone bathe. I am beginning to be able to distinguish individuals with my eyes closed, by their scent.   I witnessed something horrifying a few days ago, from which I am only now recovering sufficient control of my hands to write it down. One of the younger males has lately developed a liking for me, and has been taking me with him to hunt. The season so far has been bountiful, and there is plenty of game, not to mention a profusion of berries, acorns, and pine-nuts to ease our hunger along the way. On this particular morning, my companion led me to a boulder field that struck me with its harsh beauty. I thought we were merely going to pass through on our way to the woods at the other side, but he kept heading for the cliff from which these boulders had broken off long ago. And then we began to climb. I could only keep up with the greatest effort, but he was patient and came back to pull me up a couple of times when I could not find the handholds myself. At last we reached a fairly broad ledge that is invisible from below. My companion pointed back the way we came and waved, but when I looked I saw no one, only a squirrel dashing from one boulder to another. My host then put both hands on my shoulders, which I have come to understand means 'Stay here'. And then he started up the face of the cliff again. As I watched, he scaled the sheer wall as easily as a spider, and then, unbelievably, continued up as the rock face curved outward to form the underside of a kind of platform at the top. There he hung supine a moment, twisting his head completely around to look at me with what might have been a smile. Then came the sound of crunching gravel, and a soldier stepped onto the platform. What happened next was so quick I would have missed it had not my eyes already been popping at the sight. The soldier spotted me and came to the edge to get a closer look. At the same time my companion somehow slipped around onto the platform behind the soldier, then slapped his hands and feet smartly on the flat stone. The soldier wheeled around, and the creature leaped at him, making a frightful noise &mdash; like a hiss and a screech together. The soldier jumped back, right over the edge. My comrade was around the underside of the platform again before the soldier could make a sound. When he did find his voice, of course, it didn't matter. What followed was even more appalling. The soldier's body was shattered on the sharp rocks below me, but the fall did not quite kill him. What finished him off was the rest of my new 'family', who appeared instantly around the groaning man, ripped him joint from joint with their incredibly strong hands, and then vanished almost immediately with the fragments. All that was left was a splatter of blood, steaming on the stones. I must have fainted, because I remember nothing of how I got back here to the cave. I cannot think about this any more.   This morning when I awoke, I found myself alone with the Old One who tends the box. (Beyond a certain age, it is impossible to distinguish male from female among these creatures.) The rest I believe are gone for what I call Thaw Day, the first time it is possible to actually get out of the cave where we spend the winter. Last year I tried to go with them, but it is much too dangerous out on the rocks for a stumbler like me until all the ice is melted. So this year they have wisely left me behind, and I willingly bow to their wisdom. Knowing they would be out foraging and hunting until sunset, I will occupy my time by contemplating my own sorry story, in other words, to live up to my nickname at last. It was my friend, now the Golias, who dubbed me the Historian, in one of our many youthful bouts of drinking ourselves sick &mdash; before his father, then the Golias, drove us apart. For a long time I was bitter, but I was sure my friend would not forget me when he came into his kingdom. When he did in fact ascend the throne, my old friend would not even answer my letters, let alone permit me to see him. It was then I began to understand what fortune means, and I ceased to blame my friend for only being what he was destined to be: a man required by his privilege to cut off anyone who was a danger to it. I threatened his position because I was a drunken fool who used to play with him, who in fact still loved him, was as besotted with love for him as with the drink I swilled to try to forget him. I was an embarrassment at best, at worst a potential weapon that his enemies could use against him &mdash; and what man endowed with power has no enemies? My anger was now directed not at my friend, but at such a world as made our friendship impossible. A drunkard's anger, in other words, hopeless on purpose, a fine reason for another drink. Such foolish rage is not without its wisdom, of course: the world is in fact evil and cruel, does in fact drive friends and lovers apart, and for what purpose? Only to continue as it is, without discomforting those whose comfort is the reason for its working the way it does. Being drunk took away the restraint that makes people do their duty no matter how bad it is for them, no matter how unworthy the cause. I had no duty, except what I perversely regarded as my love for the truth, when in fact all I really loved was the bottle or the wineskin and the sound of my own voice. And my gift for words, especially words of disparagement &mdash; how easily they tripped out of my mouth once I'd poured the sweet liquor in! And how brave I was, telling anyone within earshot just how craven were the masters of this world! Well, someone finally listened, and for my courageous acts of defiance took me to that awful place, where my first and worst torment was being deprived of a drink. In a way the sessions with the Examiners were a consolation for the aching loss I felt once my hangover cleared. At least they gave me something else to think about. But even the pain became boring after a time &mdash; until my last Examiner appeared, and taught me what real pain can be.   The box is made of the same material as my notebook, but stiffened so that it keeps its shape. The Old One spends all her time tending it &mdash; polishing, restitching the joints, inscribing little marks on its surface. Actually it is not quite a box, but more of a satchel, with a handle and also a longer strap for carrying from place to place when we have to move camp. I never even noticed it until we had been in winter quarters for quite a while, and even then I thought it was merely the Old One's notebook, the same as everyone else has, only somewhat larger. And I had long before lost interest the others' notebooks &mdash; all they did was copy the same figures over and over, the way children do, and, like children, once a page was covered with squiggles, it was often left behind or trodden underfoot. That's what finally brought the box to my attention, the fact that she protected it, always kept it with her, either on her lap or strapped to her side...","HistoriansNotebook.html"],
	["Historian's Tale","I see you have adopted the methods of your former master &mdash; wasn't he known as the Good Doctor? What is your sweet scriptor's name? Markito? Dear Egderus, he's prettier than you, but not as pretty as you were then, the last time I saw you, when we almost... O my dear, how often I've thought of you, your sweet mouth, your deer's eyes, how the tears rolled down your face when you drove me away! I loved you for saving me, of course, but had our meeting been different, I would have loved you a better way. (Pain, cannot speak.) Now I am more lame than you, little Egderus, and only because I was careless. They tried to teach me not to be careless, but I was never a good student, except on my own projects. It was the same heedlessness that brought me into the Good Doctor's clutches. But that also brought me to you, did it not? So yesterday's evil blesses me today. And perhaps my demise will mean a great victory for you, in some way that neither of us can foresee. As a historian, which many people believed me to be, I saw that such things have always happened, all the time. And as a man who can no longer walk, I perceive the abyss beneath the feet of everyone who can, though they do not see it, and would be unable to move if they could. Perhaps you've known this all along, and can only wonder why it took me all this time to find it out. I was unable to get very far from the town before being caught again. But I had learned a trick or two from your evil master. My new captor was a farm boy, as ugly as he was stupid, and it was no great feat to kill him. I had never killed a man before, but it was easy once I realized... I was willing to do it. Or anything else, for that matter, to keep that evil man from taking me again. I hope our little prank caused him some... discomfort in return. If he is dead, I hope he suffered at the end. In a way, I welcome my own end, as it will free me finally from the very idea of him. I doubt I have time for a long story, but ask me what you will. Robenc? I do not know the name. Did he? I thought it was only you. To say true, little brother, I remember only three people from those awful days &mdash; the Good Doctor, the Bone-Snapper, and you. I &mdash; (Pain, cannot speak.) How I've longed for this day, dearest friend, and now there is no time! At the bottom of the cliff, perhaps in the water, though I hope not, is a satchel. It went over the edge when I fell. In it are the most precious artifacts to be found in this world, because they do not come from this world: that other world was so magnificent as to make the Golias in all his splendor look like a farmer dressed up for a neighbor's wedding. I have stolen these things. I don't believe they will be missed soon, but when they are, there may be some trouble for you. I am sorry for that. Who they belonged to is explained in my notebook. Maybe Markito here could go fetch the satchel? I believe it's important that everything in it be kept dry, and not be permitted to freeze. (Cries out. Pain longer, deeper. E examines him. Blood on his chin now.) (Mumbles, nonsense sounds.) ...I was drunk, giving a speech... funny stories, making things up! ... some drinking place, surrounded by friends. Well &mdash; they laughed at my jokes. I was brilliant, my tongue sang by itself, the perfect phrases just tumbling out... They were all looking at me... their eyes shining... Maybe...

	["House, Hills","...The house sprawled around the end of the lake, which itself nestled in a cleft between the two spikes which topped the mountain. It was difficult to imagine what it had been used for prior to its earliest known function as a hill fortress &mdash; its design was much too exposed. The oldest section of the house, right on the point of the lake where it drained off into the steep cleft between the horns, contained a number of very large halls, each with more than one fireplace. This section, three stories high, was covered by a steep peaked roof and capped by a tower. Under the peak ran a long corridor with rooms opening off it on either side, which served as the dormitory for all but the Frater himself, whose quarters were in the tower. Beneath this dormitory floor was the balcony overlooking a room known inexplicably as the Parlor, a huge open two-story auditorium which could have been used for large public meetings or entertainments. Directly beneath the Parlor was the refectory, a dark, low-ceilinged expanse with long tables and numerous alcoves. In this refectory, as one faced the lake, along the right wall was the Frater's library, screened off by heavy wood paneling inset with translucent glass windows. The Frater's study could be entered through a door on the lake end of this small library. Outside, the lower porch made an ell around the left and lake sides of the refectory; the upper porch ran along the three outward sides of the Parlor above. Set behind the refectory was the entrance hall, low and wide but not very deep, which was dominated by a huge ornate staircase, wide enough to drive a team of horses easily between its railings. This stairway led up to the Parlor, the balcony, and the dormitory. Beneath the entry was a cellar of uncertain proportions, which could only be reached by an ill-kept and rickety stairway hidden beneath a heavy table in the Frater's library (study?). To the left and right were the ruins of what must have been a magnificent residence or, perhaps, a very well-appointed garrison. As one faced the lake, the left or north-east wing, which had been made of wood, looked like a long burial mound with the rotted stumps of planks and beams sticking out here and there. The right or south-west wing had been made of stone, and a few stretches of wall still remained standing, along with the shadowy outline of rooms approximately equal in size to those in the dormitory. Access to both wings had long ago been walled off by stones from the collapsed south-west wing. Behind and down the hill from the house were scattered the foundations of outbuildings, all in ruins, with no hint of what their purpose might have been, although one or two of them must have been used for stables and barns. The mountain itself, as has been said, continued upward on either side of the lake, terminating in two cliffs at the end opposite the house. Atop the cliff to the south-east was a ruined tower. The other, on the north-east, had no structure upon it. Both commanded views of the entire mountain and all of its approaches, the south-east cliff to the south and west, the other to the north and east. The only easy approach was from the east, where the town hunched in the valley below. It was possible to gain the lower reaches of the mountain from almost any direction, but no way to get near the plateau of the lake and house other than by way of the main road, unless one scaled impossible heights to approach the lake from the opposite side, right under the eyes of the lookouts on the twin cliffs.","HouseHills.html"],

The left-behinds of a wonderful picnic, cut short by a sudden squall: the gleaners come, pick through the trash, covetous, hoarding, so soon to be picked through themselves. Our putative author is one such temporarily able-bodied seeker. Throughout this exercise he has operated on the bread-crumb or skein-of-yarn principle, that down there (in his formulation) is a gate (trap-door?) through which we have passed (risen?) from one plenteousness into another. From throbbing dark magnificence into blinding freezing light, for example. But the maelstrom disappears when the sea calms.

	["in the Keep","My Keeper took some pleasure in interrogating me. I knew well what he was doing, perhaps better than he: asking questions that made no sense; commanding me to explain why I had done things I had not done, and about which I knew nothing; moving me from place to place, but all underground, so that I would lose all sense of time; allowing me only enough rest so that I could survive the next session; and so on. He plainly appreciated that torment of the mind is more effectual than violence to the body: I was given moldy bread and foul water, and deprived of any covering but the filthy night garment in which I had been arrested, but although the guards were quite rough when they hauled me to and fro in the Keep, they never struck me or hurt me in any other way. He also showed considerable intuition in teasing out my weaknesses: his probings rarely failed to produce some outburst of impatience or indignation, and this gratified him greatly, as if I had disclosed essential information &mdash; which, in the way of these things, I had just done. I confess I was fascinated by this reversal of roles, at how easily I lost a grip on my feelings &mdash; and it made no difference that I knew exactly what he was doing, could even predict when he would do it. Naturally he never left me alone long enough to regain my composure, to steel myself for the next onslaught. But my Keeper and I also knew well that the longer our sessions went on, the more durable my resistance might become; in such matters, it is imperative to crack the Client's spirit before his weakness finds its strength. And my tormentor, though able, even talented, was unseasoned, his eagerness in his work too unfocused and raw. I could tell that he was personally concerned in this matter. When he saw me see this in him, it was an electrifying moment for us both. Even I, with my greater experience, did not expect the cunning of his next gambit. He humbly asked me to evaluate his technique. He said he had long been in awe of me: I was a legend. He said he considered it a personal honor to be allied with me; he said, in fine, that he would much prefer for me to be his teacher than his prisoner. When I merely gaped at him, he did exactly what I would have done: he directed the Bone-Snapper to break my thumbs. Of course this was not necessary, for in that moment my will shattered and I gave up, gave in, surrendered to whatever torture lay in store, even welcomed it &mdash; not because I deserved it: I deserved nothing, I was entitled to nothing, there was nothing left to me to defend &mdash; &mdash; and my heart flooded with love. Little children, this is how helpless we are. We armor ourselves with possessions, with alliances, with principles; we shake these things in each other's faces, hackles raised, quivering with wrath; we huddle together in families, in nations, in mobs; we say 'this but not that', we say 'you but not your brother', we say 'us', we say 'them'. We say 'save us!', we say 'No.'   I do not know how much longer I remained in the Keep &mdash; probably not long. I seem to remember being bathed like a baby in warm water and sweet-smelling soap by two cooing women who dried me and wrapped me in a soft blanket, then rolled me into bed, where I must have slipped immediately into dreamless sleep &mdash; unless the whole experience was a dream.

I don't see the point, so I sit in this little room off the back porch (where the gardener used to sleep, when we still had one), gazing out the window and daydreaming. Not long ago I was just like her, scurrying around, trying to stock up, frantic to get everything finished before we had to lock the gate. Well, now that worry is over: nothing to be done any more. About anything. She can't stand that kind of thinking: to her it's giving up, something she never could do, once she's made up her mind. I admire that in her: I dither constantly, or did, when it seemed there was a chance, something to do to make things better, if only to stave off the inevitable. But she doesn't believe in the inevitable. Maybe she knows she's wrong about that, but what she doesn't see the point of is just caving in to it, surrendering. Maybe this difference balances us off somehow, I don't know. She's only being herself, I keep telling myself. I'm no different in this respect &mdash; not that I'm a pessimist, far from it: if anything I'm the romantic in this duo, there's always hope &mdash; except... no there isn't. Not any more. Might as well face it, take a break at last, ease up on myself. And everyone else. Not she. She could never stand to stand still &mdash; she told me right away: as soon as it became even a faint possibility that we would end up together, she provided me with a list of all the things about her that might drive me crazy, many of which do, it turns out. Can't say I wasn't warned. But actually, I really don't care. Neither of us is going to change &mdash; there's been plenty of chance for that, and it just didn't happen, so now here we are. Stuck in the kind of situation no one ever thought &mdash;... On the other hand, there's nothing like this kind of situation to kill off my fretMachine spinning & spinning inside, the kind that makes a person worry and fuss over all kinds of trivial things that don't matter a damn. Well, there's never been this kind of situation, either, at least not around here, in my life or hers. So I figure I may as well just be myself as much as I can, but also give her all the room she wants to be herself as well. Can't hurt. Well, yes it can &mdash; I'm just saying there's really nothing else to do, except to poison everything she does or wants to, and that's even more pointless than doing nothing. Not that it matters a damn what I do or what she does. About anything.   The pale gray light on the mountain opposite is just warming now, and the birds have calmed down, as they do once the sun's fully up, to the occasional lazy warble or tweet. Half an hour ago their noise was nearly deafening: roosters, crows, robins, sparrows, wrens, catbirds, doves &mdash; all of them (maybe even the roosters, but who knows what they're yelling about all day long and half the night) calling to their mates, pleading, urgent, 'Honey, please, please! It's springtime, we got work to do, we need to get busy, you and me, we need to do it NOW.' That's fine for them. Whatever is about to happen to us, they'll go on just as if we never showed up to wreck their nests and mess up their little lives &mdash; which of course aren't little at all, they're life-sized, just like ours are to us. Maybe there are beings we can't even imagine looking down in pity on our little lives, thinking of us as poor tiny things that just ended up in the road of whatever it is that sweeps things away now and then. Or whatever it is that's going to happen, that is happening right now, though we may not see it or hear it or feel it yet. But we will. And we know it; have known it all along but didn't think it was going to get all the way to us, somehow, or not before we could make our getaway. But that's the thing about being wrong: it looks just like being right, until you learn your mistake. I think I'll let my sweetie sleep a little longer. Then when she gets up, I'll do whatever she thinks up for me to do with gratitude and an open heart. I know she's just trying to keep us busy, and I want her happy.","keepingbusy.html"],

My sense is it was the cold brought him to me, but, though he follows me everywhere, he won't let me near him, bolts right away if I even head in his direction [margin note: gone for hours], & he screeches something awful if I speak to him. So I let him be, leave him food here & there, & go about my business. I've had to give up talking to myself, though, when he's around. It distresses him so; I think it's the sound more than anything, because even when he's screaming, he claps his hands over his ears as if to shut out the noise. [insert] >> He won't let me touch him, but once in a while he'll reach out & tap me with a stick or something. Yesterday I took hold of a long stalk he was pointing at me, & he let me hold it a moment before dropping his end & sprinting away << He wasn't with the others when I left them & came here; all I can think is that he must've been caught outside. Hard to believe anyone could've survived that; possibly his story's even stranger than I can imagine.   What made me leave the House was them standing in a circle, holding hands, heads bowed. I can't tell you why that public posture revolted me so, but it did, especially when suddenly assumed by a group who up until that moment had been behaving like ordinary people. Part of it, I think, is it looks showy to me; part is also its blatant lack of sense; but worst of all is its waste of concentration, when there's so much work to be done. Then I remembered: there's nothing to be done. So it makes no difference. Does no good, maybe &mdash; but, maybe, does no harm neither. If they feel better, let them go ahead. But not in front of me &mdash; makes my skin crawl. So for this among many much better reasons, I'm making camp out here.   Last night for the first time he fell asleep in front of me. I wasn't exactly paying attention &mdash; just staring into the embers, probably dozing myself. One minute his eyes are fixed on me across the flames; next time I look up they're closed (rather hooded), and his hands & face are twitching, like a dog hunting through his dreams, or more likely the squirrel the dog is hunting.   I went back to the House today, for some reason, and everyone is gone. The place is utterly empty. It's possible, I guess, that they've left on a trek somewhere, maybe to look for others like themselves, if there are any. I could keep things going here &mdash; the boy & I've become accustomed to each other &mdash; but it's getting cold, and when the first snow hits I'm pretty sure I'd rather be watching a fire in one o' them fine rooms than scrabbling for sticks out here in the woods. I bet there's food left there, too, in places the others maybe didn't think to look. The boy'll be a problem, though. What do I do? He's taken to following me when I gather wood or check the traps &mdash; as long as I don't go near the House. As soon as I get even close he just vanishes, & I'll find him back here at camp when I return. (Or not &mdash; he's a very independent person.) He trusts me now enough to sleep mostly through the night, but I don't know what he'll think or do if I 'abandon' him to go live in the House. I could try to do it gradually, just move camp a little closer bit by bit, but there just isn't time &mdash; snow's coming, I can smell it. Of course, he can, too, I'd bet.

We realize our mistake: in ourWorld, the secret of flight is to be a bird. If we want to fly, we must change ourselves, or change the world. Or make a new one, and move there.","LastOneflying.html"],
	["Legomenon for Writings from the AGE of EGDERUS","In some ways, this timeBand affords the richest trove of Writings in the Archives: introduced by the fragmentary log of an Insurgent fighting an unknown enemy, Egderus' extended Testament tells us how he came into possession of the Archives that bear his name, and his numerous ancillary Writings provide a vivid portrait of political and religious life during his era. Here are what scholars have long believed to be the final Writings of the founder, including his secret message to his imagined successor. In addition, we here find the intriguing story of M, thought by some to be the mysterious Missionary to the Remnant, plus a text each from four other 'colleagues' of Egderus: Aric, the Bone-Snapper, the Historian, and the Superius Frater. Finally, we are introduced to an Author not elsewhere represented in the Archives, the otherwise unnamed Old Poet.","LegomenonforAGEofEGDERUS.html"],
	["Legomenon for Writings from the AGE of the SCHOLAR","All the texts in this timeBand belong to contemporaries of the unnamed Scholar who rediscovered the Archives in the era between that of Egderus and our own. They draw an intimate portrait, from individual perspectives, of events surrounding the destruction of the Temple, a catastrophic event that, as numerous later scholars have argued, followed directly from the Scholar's disastrous attempt to present his discovery of the Archives to the authorities of his time. Whether or not this hypothesis is valid, there is no doubt that the Temple's downfall crippled the civilization of which it was the beacon, and a kind of dark age followed that, in certain respects, continues to this day, though of late the progress in reconstructing the Archives has been paralleled in the outside world by vigorous growth and flourishing. We must hope that this recovery continues apace, without our somehow blundering into the same mistakes that brought to a violent end each of the three eras previous to our own: that of the Scholar, of Egderus, and of the Ancients. In the Writings of the Scholar's time it is possible to establish some sequence in their composition. The most recent of these is the account of the unnamed Soldier who rescues two victims of his own company's savagery contains a hint that he also came to salvage the writings of another Author, the Exile, who had just left the group before the attack. The latter's works tell us he was being pursued for a cause we never learn, but it is difficult not to suspect he was involved (or was thought to be so) in the demolition of the Temple. A little closer to that ruinous event is another single narrative, that of the Unknown Scholastic, who it seems did play a role in the conspiracy that brought the Temple down, and even though that role remains hazy, the Author's intent in furthering the plot is made very clear. A related group of personal stories, those of the so-called Voice from the Locust Grove &mdash; a close friend of the former Scholastic, give an extended account of the context and immediate aftermath of the event. And finally there are the numerous Writings of the Scholar himself, who found and then lost the Archives, but who prepared the way for them to find us.","LegomenonforAGEoftheSCHOLAR.html"],
	["Legomenon for the career soldier ARIC","Aric is first mentioned in the Archives as one of the co-conspirators in the so-called 'Rescue Plot' that freed the Historian and disgraced the Good Doctor. The Writing {Testimony of Praetor Aric} is a transcript, either in deposition or in open court, given during the investigation into the affair. It follows the traditional format of a scriptor's 'realization', wherein only the utterances of the interview subject are recorded &mdash; but, as in most realizations, the interlocutor's questions are not difficult to infer. Later, in the epistolary {Aric: Aftermath}, Aric describes to Egderus what really happened when his commander Robenc confronted the Good Doctor at the latter's lodgings. According to the problematic {Postscript in Aric's own hand} found among the Last Writings of Egderus, it was Aric who carried out the assassination of the 8th Superius Frater of Mountain House, Egderus' mentor and predecessor in that office &mdash; the motivation of which remains a mystery. There is also ambiguous evidence in The Missionary's Writings that implicate Aric as the man who broke his spirit and set him on the road to conversion.","LegomenonforARIC.html"],

A separate Writing found with it, {making this up}, seems at first to contradict this hypothesis, though a thoughtful reading yields a more ambiguous interpretation: even if the events recalled in the first Writing 'really happened', the only way they could be known outside the time and place of their occurrence requires the use not only of memory &mdash; unreliable at best in retrieving past events into present time &mdash; but text, about which the cantankerous Last One is quite blunt in his critique: Text is the enemy. As elsewhere, but particularly in the oldest Writings in the Archives, the generous use of ellipses (...) in these evident transcriptions could be a sign that they were originally dictations, where the inscriber wished to indicate a pause during which the speaker weighed what to say next, or else just a moment when thought trailed off...","LegomenonforBOY.html"],
	["Legomenon for the founder of the Archives EGDERUS","Egderus is the hub around which wheels the constellation of Writings in the Archives, and his own Writings are more numerous and extensive than those of any other Author herein. Until the advent of the Scholar, Egderus was known only as a minor official of the Golias, the king or ruling warlord of that era. In the comparatively extensive Testament discovered (or, perhaps better said, revealed) by the Scholar, we learn that Egderus was also an archivist, and some of the artifacts he collected and transmitted belong to what is in effect an alien World, that of the Ancients, who in his day were universally believed to be the Deities responsible for Creation. But Egderus evidently came to regard the Ancients as mere mortals like ourselves, and concluded that it was their own actions that brought about the demise of their world; further, it was the Ancients whose descendants, ultimately, we are. This is the so-called 'We Descend' heresy that was for so long so explosive, ostensibly the cause of the Scholar's expulsion from the Conference of his peers &mdash; and which also adumbrates a body of wisdom that had to be preserved and passed on in secret over the course of many generations. Today we have little difficulty accepting that we are merely the latest in a long line of civilizations that arose from and fell back into the earth of our island home. But the lessons to be drawn from the transmission of these tales of our ancient forebears have yet to be fully realized... Egderus' earliest Writings belong to his so-called Testament, a memoiric account of his early life, presumably written at a mature age, which come to us in three longish 'chapters'. The first such section of the Testament, for convenience titled {Egderus at Mountain House}, describes life in the remote eremitic community in which he grew up, focusing on a weird event &mdash; the death and dismemberment of the captain of the small garrison guarding the house, a terrifying man called Gig, and Egderus' possible implication in the murder, a question left unresolved at the end. The next segment of the Testament, {Egderus and the Good Doctor}, takes up the narrative with its Author's employment in the Great City, as secretary to the former Prior of Mountain House, who liked to be called (for reasons unknown) the Good Doctor, and who oversees 'examinations' of heretics in the Office of Inquiry. While there, Egderus becomes enamored of one of the Good Doctor's 'clients', a man known only as the Historian, and finds a potential ally in Praetor Robenc, whom he also knew back at Mountain House. A plan to help the Historian escape ripens in the third chapter of the Testament, {Rescue Plot}, in which Egderus joins with Robenc's Adjutant Aric in, along with other devices, preparing documents to discredit the Good Doctor. The Testament concludes with {First Sermon of Egderus}, delivered to the community at his old home, Mountain House, after his banishment there for his part in the so-called Rescue Plot. There follow some miscellaneous Writings, only one of which, {torrential}, can be dated with any certainty, to just after Egderus' return to Mountain House, a period of political upheaval, when his peaceful community is overrun by the wounded and the dead from an unidentified battle nearby. Two further memoiric Writings, the anecdote {The scriptor and his beloved} and the fantastical {a dream of the Great City} may once have been part of the Testament, but if so their context has been lost. The first seems to date from the period of Egderus' employment with the Good Doctor, but at the same time hints at his working in secret on some kind of unspecified archive &mdash; and Egderus' authorship of this fragment has been challenged with some success. The second, a striking dream narrative, could have been composed at almost any time in Egderus' long life. The affectionate reminiscence {New Year} presents a lively picture of life in Mountain House when Egderus was quite young, and introduces a happy lay brother, his helper and first companion, as well as an odd beggar who may well be the Old Poet, composer of {patteran}, or someone like him. The final Writings collected here were written when Egderus was quite an old man. It is not known whether he survived the turmoil of his time, or was swept away along with so many of his friends and contemporaries in the Goliadic Wars, but we must believe that he met this last challenge with the courage and resourcefulness he had shown throughout his life &mdash; not least in contriving, in the midst of the total disintegration of his world, to collect and pass along to us the Archives that came to bear his name. The order of composition of these so-called Last Writings is of course conjectural, but they are presented here is what feels to be their most edifying sequence. Towards the end of his life, after taking on as his secretary the young mute Markito (whimsically described in {Markito Scriptor}), Egderus is surprised by the return of an old lover, the Historian, a meeting described in {Egderus and the Historian}, where the 'present' borne by the Historian, who is near death, hints at the source of at least part of what became the Archives under Egderus' curacy. In what may be part of a sermon, {What can we do here?}, Egderus presents first thoughts on preparing his isolated refuge for the world catastrophe he feared would soon reach its door. An apparent follow-up memorandum, possibly a fragment of the same sermon, {threefold mission}, more definitively lays out the framework of action partially foreseen in the previous Writing; then, after a lacuna, he turns his attention to understanding the state of mind of those from the other side, urging compassion coupled with a warning. It is in the address {this work} that Egderus shows his character most fully, exhorting his followers (and us) to remember our place in the procession of all the generations of our kind. A former curator provided the title {Egderus' Last Writings} to this composite document, and the distress impelling Egderus in these final texts is itself distressing, but its cause is impossible to determine. The provenance of {Egderus' Secret} remains a secret.","LegomenonforEGDERUS.html"],
	["Legomenon for an unknown EXILE","The whole of this Author's 'story' is difficult to establish with any certainty: no external clue has yet been found to definitively link him to any other person in the Archives (with the obvious &mdash; but unverified &mdash; exception of the Author of {purple berries}), and the overall narrative roughed out by this clutch of fragmentary Writings proffers only tantalizing hints. As elsewhere, however, this has not prevented &mdash; indeed it has certainly inspired &mdash; extensive theorization, about where he fled from, where he fled to, what precipitated his flight, and, most mysterious of all, how his Writings came to be part of the Archives Pertaining to Egderus Scriptor at all. One of the most tenacious theories links the Author here called the Exile with the Writing {this work}, most often attributed to Egderus &mdash; the hypothesis being that this person was one of the band of insurgents mentioned in that Writing who are about to leave on a mission to 'carry out acts of interference' against 'the enemy', a powerful figure tyrannizing the world, or so he is described there. Presumably, in this postulation, these acts of resistance were unsuccessful, and the Exile was forced to flee alone, perhaps the only survivor of the expedition. However, the fragmentary profile provided by the Exile's Writings could fit any number of similar scenarios, including a more recent theory (preferred here) that places him among the 'terrorists' who brought down the Temple during the Scholar's time, generations after Egderus. Although this latter story line presents fewer problems, it affords no more concrete evidence to support its surmises than any other. The sequence in which these Writings are here presented is speculative, of course, but it does seem to make general sense on the basis of internal evidence. The first Writing, {fog} sketches in the Exile's situation: escaping capture, he has, after a long and arduous flight, found temporary haven in a foreign town, a stranger who knows nothing of the local language or customs, but nontheless feels safe, at least for the time being. The lyrical {drawn} describes how the Exile's day begins, and the ambivalence he feels about being pulled into the town's life: even though he knows no one and no one knows him, for the moment at least, he still feels that he might be a danger to the community in which he has found temporary refuge... In the next Writing, {stars}, the Exile remembers with fondness and longing his early adventures in a large city where he made a life as a performing artist... But an unexpected {fire} breaks out in the town, and the Exile becomes involved, against his will, for he fears 'discovery' by (or through) his engagement in this emergency... Then, in {place}, he witnesses a traditional ceremony that re-enacts another search for refuge... Eventually, in {Manhunter Moon} the Exile is welcomed tentatively into his community, causing him to offer up a kind of prayer of thanksgiving. Soon, however &mdash; as he foresaw from the beginning &mdash; his sanctuary is wrecked, most likely by his pursuers, as recounted in {attack}. But he is able to aid a small number of his new companions to escape, among whom he forms an odd friendship, with the {grandmother} or elder of the group, who reappears briefly in the last extant Writing of the Exile, the tragic {flight} &mdash; and may figure in the possibly related story {purple berries}, a supposition addressed in its proper place, the {Legomenon for SOLDIER}.","LegomenonforEXILE.html"],
	["Legomenon for Egderus' friend called the HISTORIAN","This oddly-named person appears as a character (or at least a referent) in numerous other Writings &mdash; by Egderus, Aric, the mysterious Missionary, and even the Scholar who curated most if not all of the others' Writings generations later. This phenomenon has made it possible to work out a more complete (if still speculative) chronology of the Historian's life than can be done for almost any other figure in the Archives: As a young man, the Historian was (for a time, at least) the favorite of the (or a) son of the Golias who ruled in Egderus' youth, and it was during this period that he met and debated the Missionary; Later, he somehow fell foul of the Office of Inquiry, and was imprisoned and tortured by the Good Doctor during the period when Egderus served as the latter's scriptor; Egderus, Aric, and Aric's commander, Robenc, conspired to free the Historian (each for a different reason) by bringing down the Good Doctor; In his flight from the city, the Historian took refuge in the mountains, where he was rescued by a small group of apparently aboriginal people, possibly members of the so-called Remnant, from whom he later carried off a box containing sacred artifacts, as he recounts in his 'deathbed' confession, transcribed in {Historian's Tale}. The theft set in motion a calamitous sequence of events that resulted not only in his own death, but in the total extermination of his erstwhile rescuers, as a consequence of their vengeful pursuit of him into the domain of the Golias; This box, along with his Notebook, was recovered by Egderus and his scriptor Markito, as described in {Egderus and the Historian}. The artifact from which the text of {Historian's Notebook} was originally extracted of course no longer exists, but it is described within its own pages as a kind of writing kit given him by his hosts, made of stiff sheets of cured skin or bark upon which he scratched letters with a stylus, which we can imagine was fashioned from a sharpened stick or shard of bone. Many commentators &mdash; the Scholar first among them &mdash; have found this Writing implausible enough to prompt skepticism about the Archives as a whole, given the Notebook's complex (some would say overly convenient) intertwingling with so many other stories told therein. But there is a countercurrent of opinion that regards this kind of pyrrhonism as mere literary snobbery, and admires the lyrical quality of the Notebook's portrait of an autochthonous people transmitting a deeper truth about the Remnant &mdash; and the entire culture of Egderus' time &mdash; than can necessarily be 'proved' by mere evidentiary factuality. Finally, the attribution of {all fall down} to the Historian is perhaps tenuous, though of long standing, despite its evident resemblance to the thought and perspective of that Ancient critic, the Last One.","LegomenonforHISTORIAN.html"],
	["Legomenon for Midnight Writings of the so-called INSOMNIAC","It is hard not to notice that among the Writings in the Archives a certain number take as their setting the middle of the night, when the speaker is unable to sleep. Further, the voice in some of these nocturnal meditations seems deeply related to that in other Writings, so much so that it has been put forth that it is the same voice in all. This may go too far &mdash; certainly the circumstances in some narratives appear to be inconsistent with each other, but the similarity of the state of mind of their Author(s) was thought sufficiently pronounced to warrant placing them together under one heading. Not one of these Writings bore a title in its original state, and their arrangement here is not intended to propose any kind of progression in the chronology of their composition &mdash; or theme, if such a through-line can be educed. The first of these 'Midnight Writings', {awake}, begins with the mysterious world that only comes to life when the rest of us are asleep, the enchanted speaker absorbing and exploring its contours like a person at a concert, listening to a familiar piece yet hearing the music as if for the first time. After a while, however, a note of anxious weariness creeps in, in ironic contrast to the eternal peace of the music of the night. In much the same mood, {the dark} seems to describe the development of a novel, possibly menacing situation to which the speaker has yet to become completely adapted, and yet resolves not to give in to fear or self-pity, but rather to appreciate what is happening as much, and as long, as possible. Obviously, the speaker in {pass it on} has come to the end of life, and one imagines the placing of its last period as the penultimate action its speaker ever takes (or in any case intends to). And yet, {the moonlit garden}, its companion piece (the two Writings were found right together), seems to counterpose the wise Saying of the Remnant, Anything can always happen.","LegomenonforINSOMNIAC.html"],
	["Legomenon for an unknown partisan INSURGENT","Near the end of his tenure as Superius Frater of Mountain House, Egderus Scriptor, the founder of the Archives, was required to contend with an unexpected crisis: the urgent necessity to repurpose his home, for generations an eremitic retreat for persons wishing to withdraw from worldly concerns, into a refuge for survivors of a genocidal campaign which twice engulfed that very world. In the latter case, part of that redirection in the Mission of his order entailed giving reluctant blessing to a group of his charges bent on acts of resistance against 'the enemy', an autocratic warlord bent on world domination (or destruction). Of the fate of this band of resistors, only one record survives: {on march}, a fragment describing its early exploits in a campaign that, if it ever got fully underway, has not been documented elsewhere, and what became of them is unknown.","LegomenonforINSURGENT.html"],
	["Legomenon for the Father of the Archives, the self-named LAST ONE","The Writings of the self-described Last One are naturally of the first importance, and not only because they are among the oldest primary texts in the Archives: whatever the catastrophe that brought the world of the Ancients to an end, their Author's liminal status &mdash; as one of the few who survived it &mdash; makes him the Father of the Archives, whose seed-texts comprised not only his personal jottings but also Writings from Before that were in his possession at the time. The Writings of this Author fall into two categories: memoiric accounts of life in the immediate aftermath of the cataclysm that made him the last but one of the Ancients, and the theoretic discourse of a trenchant thinker struggling to comprehend from his lonely perspective what caused his race to self-immolate. The earliest of this prolific Author's Writings is the apparent diary entry here called {Last One and Boy}, which is rather a composite of fragments than a consistent narrative, likely written very soon after the events it describes: the adoption of a lost young boy in the immediate aftermath of what the Last One calls 'whatever hit us'. The lyrical {mornings of creation} presents an almost idyllic picture of the Last One's companionship with the otherwise unnamed Boy he into his care; it is instructive to compare this with the Boy's own memoir in {return}. The somewhat later Writing {they're coming apart...} strikes a rather elegiac tone, in which the Author recalls the dear ones of his former life. And finally among his autobiographic Writings, in {what to leave behind} the Last One considers what the Boy will need after he is left alone... As mentioned, it was almost certainly the Last One whose holdings constituted the anthology of texts Egderus later used to form the Archives bearing his name. In addition to his fragmentary memoirs, the Last One brought to bear his considerable intellect in Writings that, taken together, contain what might be called the distillation of his thought. In a kind of prolegomenon, the gnomic {impatience}, the Last One opens his discursus by indirectly proposing that the lack (or failure) of forbearance may be his besetting sin, by declaring what brings in his nemeses, the ghosts. His foundational document, as it were, is {the ghosts}, which has drawn particular attention (much of it needlessly unkind, it must be said) on account of its unusual theme, leading some to ascribe this peculiar text not to an Ancient author, but to the much more recent creator (or creators) of the Romantic Impulse Writings &mdash; indeed, its peculiarity has prompted more than one accusation that the whole lobe of Writings attributed to the Last One is a fabrication &mdash; or, to be more generous, the invention of (a) fabulist(s). Need it be said? &mdash; all of the Writings in the Archives are susceptible to that kind of nihilistic joykilling, which serves no other purpose than to poison the well for everyone else. The diatribe {The Perpetrated World} sets forth the principle upon which the entire discourse rests: that the whole world we live in is a ghostly fabrication, an illusion made entirely out of text. Three corollaries follow: {Every artifact is a transmission} notes not only the profusion of text into the very objects that make up our daily lives, but also its delusory nature; {sail away} describes the intoxicating sweep of this kind of life; and {transport} proposes the further principle that text is the very dwelling place of the ghosts. A last pronouncement bookends the more or less formal discussion that begins with the invocatory {impatience}: in the acerbic {enemy}, the Last One reformulates his oft-expressed hostility towards text itself. (An earlier Curator perceived in these two offerings technical matters that prompted lengthy comment; this material has been removed to a separate Scholion {On impatience and the enemy}.) Given the Last One's antagonism towards text, the answer to the bitter riddle posed in {another life form} cannot be hard to guess. The peculiar thought experiment {mirror} implies that it may have been this invention which ultimately led to the fatal calamity that destroyed the world of his contemporaries. More broadly, in {Last One flying}, he seems to indict technology itself for their (and his) ruin. However that may be, in the almost scriptural language of {deities}, the Last One demonstrates a lyrical gift, outlining his spiritual journey from youthful faith through disillusionment to the peace he may have attained at his end, when the vaporous compulsions of the world dissolve like mist in the sun, landing him on the shore of silence and serenity at last.","LegomenonforLASTONE.html"],
	["Legomenon for the Author M, sometimes known as the MISSIONARY","The Author of the memoir {Writings of the Missionary} does not name himself except to sign the salutation to his disciples with the character 'M'. The hortatory content of its opening paragraphs has led many to attribute this Writing to the so-called Missionary to the Remnant, a legendary figure who appeared tangentially in the now-lost annals of the Golias from Egderus' time. There is considerable argument over who M actually is. Some identify the Missionary with the Good Doctor, the cruel torturer who appears in some of the Writings of Egderus himself and also of his friend, Praetor Aric. Others believe that the Writings ascribed to him are the contrivance of a later Author, composed perhaps as early as the generation following Egderus &mdash; that is to say, the generation of Markito Scriptor, Egderus' secretary and successor as Curator of the Archives, who has himself been identified by some as the pseudonymous Author 'M'. Further, certain partisans of this latter conjecture assert that Markito may in fact be the Author of all the Writings of Egderus and his contemporaries, not just their Curator. This revolutionary but intriguing notion has yet to win a majority of adherents. Three other texts have come to be credited to this Author. The first of these, entitled {M Part 2} (possibly because of its account of a second meeting with the Historian, under circumstances quite different from those of their first encounter), offers sufficient correspondence with other Writings to be challenged on the basis of being too 'convenient' &mdash; a popular charge among critics who have nothing of their own to contribute to the discourse. The validity of {in the Keep} is somewhat less tenuous: passages in {Testimony of Praetor Aric} echo this one; further, the independent but parallel Writing {Aric: Aftermath} supports giving this Writing to the former Good Doctor. It is very tempting to consider the last of these new Writings, {M the Wanderer}, as the sequel to {in the Keep}, but only because it 'feels' like the logical next step in M's story &mdash; there is no defense for this proposition to be found in the Archives other than such a feeling. The events in this Writing could just as plausibly belong to the narrator of {Peripatikos Soter}, the questSaga attributed to the much later Voice from the Locust Grove, and indeed this theory has some support, but only enough to warrant mentioning it here; the trend of opinion runs more strongly in the direction of the mysterious M.","LegomenonforTheMISSIONARY.html"],
	["Legomenon for the wayfarer OLD POET","The carefree spirit of {patteran} has long been ascribed to the odd figure known only as the Old Poet, and this ambling 'anecdote' provides a happy contrast to the consistently anxious, sometimes lugubrious mood of the other wanderers whose Writings appear in the Archives. Some say he was a government official who lost his position and then decided that this was best not only for himself but for all concerned; others propose that he was one among the many vagabond scholars who roam the world during eras of political disarray, living by their wits alone. However this may be, it is regrettable that more of his Writings have not been found &mdash; or that so many of us who read this one find ourselves unable to adopt (let alone maintain) his joyous approach to life.","LegomenonforOLDPOET.html"],
	["Legomenon for miscellaneous OTHER WRITINGS of UNKNOWN PROVENANCE","The events in a number of narratives in the Archives take place in or around a large house beside a lake in the mountains. But without independent validation, it can only be conjectured that {House, Hills} describes the setting of one or more or even all of them, as a handful insist. Still, it is easy to imagine that one reason for this apparent coincidence is that this very house served as a repository for the Writings during at least some portion of its transmission. The speculative sketch {Hypothesis} would have to be quite late, especially if its second paragraph describing the Scholar and Egderus is accepted as authentic: its apparent aim seems to be to problematize archiving itself. It is not entirely unique in this respect, nor is it the only text whose Author affects such a dark philosophical perspective, but nowhere else in the Archives is the whole project called into question. It once was thought that the gnomic Writing {The Kinds of Wildernesses} and the elegiac {The Land Where No Man Is} might be the work of the Locust Grove Author, or, as others claim, of the Author known only as M (for Missionary?). Each underwent a period of wandering that could qualify, under a generous definition, as a wilderness experience. (These sojourns are recounted in the Writings {Peripatikos Soter} and {M the Wanderer}, respectively.) However, apart from what feels like a similarity in tone to the reflective passages in one or the other of these Authors' multi-part memoirs, there is no corroborating evidence, strictly speaking, for this tender-hearted, 'Romantic' hypothesis, in either case &mdash; no matter how powerful the intuition that it is correct. It must be kept in mind, however, that this is not the same as saying it cannot be correct. The hortatory {fellowship}, one of the most recently discovered Writings to date, is still being studied and evaluated, though there is little disagreement over its authenticity. It bears striking resemblance to a much older Writing, {First Sermon of Egderus}, and may even be a separate descendant of a common ancestor, in which the speaker &mdash; for the text is plainly intended for public address, and may be a transcription, if not a version of the actual text of that oration &mdash; reminds those attending of their special status as members of the congregation they have just joined, which sets them off from the rest of humanity, in time as well as sociality. The remaining Writings of Unknown Provenance, despite clearly having different Authors, seem to share a sensibility, that of a person who has withdrawn from the world, either by choice or by force of circumstance. Here their arrangement does suggest, if only obscurely, a series &mdash; not so much of chronology (either of narrative setting or of compositional succession), but of a potentially edifying order in which to read them. The first in this last parcel of anonymous Writings, the poem {the strength of the pull of the dark} enjoins its reader (or hearer) to leave off worrying so much about why things are the way they are, but rather to simply enjoy them while they last. It has been argued that {thanksgiving} shares an Author with the Insomniac's Writing {pass it on}, apparently on the basis of tone of voice &mdash; though a successful demonstration the 'truth' of this impression has so far proved elusive... The last three of this group do, however, strongly suggest a single narrator, though their sequence here is necessarily tentative. The first, {brusque and impatient}, seems to be set in an early stage of a relationship between lovers, perhaps just when difficulties have begun to appear in actually living out the consequences of their mutual attraction. The next, {What will I do?}, hints at a later moment in the liaison, perhaps on the verge of a tragic end to this love story, its urgent question bespeaking bewilderment and (perhaps) the onset of despair. The older, seasoned couple sketched in {keeping busy} have found a more tolerant modus operandi in the face of some ominous and perhaps inevitable development in the world... Whatever the answer to such scholarly questions, the value of these unclassifiable texts to a complete view of the Archives is incontestable.","LegomenonforOTHERWRITINGSofUNKNOWNPROVENANCE.html"],
	["Legomenon for the fanciful ROMANTIC IMPULSE WRITINGS","These often whimsical Writings constitute what may have been intended as a collection of exemplary tales or fables about the personal lives of historical or semi-historical figures. It has been proposed with some success that these Writings were intended for young persons, perhaps even children. The familiar appellation 'Romantic Impulse' Writings derives from the imputed tender heart of their unidentified Author, who treats their protagonists with affection as well as respect, apparently in an effort to 'bring them to life' for readers, though this perception of their Author may itself be of Romantic (or even Sentimental) Impulse. The fragment (Young Robenc} presents a charming portrait of two of Egderus' associates, Robenc and the Superius Frater, the latter being Egderus' mentor in his earliest days at Mountain House. It is unclear whether the concluding section of this Writing was lost, or if this is an incomplete draft its Author never did finish. The even more disjunct {Robenc Returns} presents a mere sketch of what may be the prologue to that moment in his life described in the much earlier Writing {Superius Frater and Robenc}, ostensibly composed by the Frater himself. The mirroristical quality of all three Writings &mdash; they all seem to be versions a meeting between Robenc and the Superius Frater, though at different times in the participants' lives, has caused some to surmise that all are a hoax by the same hand. This seems absurdly cynical &mdash; why would anybody do that? Apparently an unfinished sketch, {The Exquisite Suzu} is unique, in that its heroine's name appears nowhere else in the archives. Although some have identified Suzu with the Author known as the Voice from the Locust Grove, the evidence for this ascription is disputed. It is commonly believed that {The Starling} may portray the 'nurse' described in the somewhat problematic {Historian's Notebook} &mdash; the young female who took care of him at the beginning of his sojourn with the Remnant (if his rescuers can be so identified). The very brief Writing {Markito Scriptor} was apparently intended to tell how Markito came to be, as some propose, the first Curator of the archives in historical times; he may in fact have done no more than help his master Egderus collect and organize the artifacts that were long afterwards discovered by the Scholar. It has been plausibly argued, however, that Markito may have been responsible for far more than this... Finally, {Starling redux} &mdash; meaning perhaps 'returning to the Starling's story'; compare {Scholar's Apology, redux} &mdash; presents a sequel to her portrayal in the original Writing that bears her name, unless her story was taken up later by a different Author. No other explanation has been put forth for this apparent anomaly.","LegomenonforROMANTICIMPULSEWRITINGS.html"],
	["Legomenon for the discoverer of Egderus' Archive SCHOLAR","Egderus may be the central figure in the saga of the Archives, but it is the unnamed Scholar who made him so, rescuing them as he did from almost certain extinction. The specific means by which the Scholar came into possession of these documents has never been determined, though the traveler (sometimes called the Fellow) who appears briefly in the Writing {Scholar's Confessio} and the later {Scholar's Apology, redux}, may provide a clue. The Scholar attempted to present these materials for discussion at the triennial Convention of his peers, but instead of winning recognition for his work, he was censured, stripped of his membership in the Conference of his colleagues, and the Archives themselves were confiscated by the ruling Council. This response was of a brutality that today is hard to credit, but it is possible that the inference to be drawn from his presentation &mdash; that the Ancients were not deities, but mere mortals like ourselves &mdash; would have been strongly anathematized at the time by the religious authorities governing the conduct of scholarly research, and the Scholar's perceived advocacy of the so-called 'We Descend' heresy was punished with the utmost severity. According to one source, the Scholar was fortunate he was not arrested, tortured, and publicly executed. Happily for us, none of that happened, and the Scholar continued, after this fatal blow to his career, to tell his story, which took an unexpected turn once he completely surrendered to his fate, and he was granted a vision of ineffable beauty: that the World is itself a Writing, which expresses not only its entire history, but also contains &mdash; to quote a tragically tiny fragment from the Ancients, itself ineffably beautiful &mdash; 'the seeds of an emergent life we cannot imagine and remain ourselves.' Perhaps not surprisingly, the Scholar has contributed more Writings to the Archive than any other Author save Egderus. His story begins in {Scholar's Diary}, where he discloses that a peculiar document has come into his possession, one that he thinks may make his career, should he present it to his colleagues in the Conference. Having decided to do so, he begins to write up his findings in the fragment {Scholar's Draft}, giving them overall context in a separate fragment {Scholar's Summary}. At this point, to his surprise, {More Writings!} come into his possession, eventually leading to his disastrous address to the Convention, the response to which crushes all his hopes. After his censure, in {Scholar's Farewell}, he addresses his successor (possibly the Unknown Curator, the Author of {archive under threat}) in what seems to be a cover letter for the materials he is forced to hand over, advising this person not to take his charge lightly. Then, relieved of his responsibility for the Archives, he describes his liberation in {Scholar's Vision}. Some time later, in the long fragment {Scholar's Confessio}, he relates the immediate aftermath of his catastrophic experience at the Convention. The opening of this Writing is so bitter in tone that some believe another person must be its creator: nowhere else in the Scholar's Writings does he speak so corrosively or with such utter despair. To such revisionists, the most popular alternative is the Author and later Curator of the archives known as The Voice from the Locust Grove. However, if this Confessio was composed more or less immediately after the events here narrated (as seems indisputable from internal evidence), the feelings engendered by those events would still have been raw and intense, hence the keenly affecting cry of the heart we find at its beginning. The lacuna (redaction?) that immediately follows this controversial passage must surely have contained description of the Scholar's actual presentation and subsequent inquisitional audience with the Council; from the point where the narrative resumes, recounting his journey home, there is little argument over the Writing's attribution to the Scholar. The odd character who briefly shares the Scholar's journey has been nicknamed the Fellow from earliest times, but has never been positively identified, nor has his mission as messenger to the Scholar been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps this byname constitutes an early surmise that he was acting as a member &mdash; or at least at the behest &mdash; of the secret order or society known as the Fellowship, which was at one time mentioned in documents that have since been discredited. The remaining documents from the Scholar's hand continue this memoir, during which the Scholar, now back home in his House in the Mountains, binds up the remains of his discovery for delivery to the courier who will shortly come to fetch them, during which process he is again visited by his new friend. Customarily presented as one Writing, the self-portrait in {Scholar's Apology} seems to start over: after a half dozen paragraphs, the Author begins the story again in {Scholar's Apology, redux}, as if he had failed to reread &mdash; or to remember accurately &mdash; what he had already written. This is not the only possible explanation for such a discrepancy, of course, and it is at puzzling interstices such as this that the curious (or skeptical) reader often turns into an investigator, compelled to search for clues that might account for the phenomenon. So far definitive evidence remains elusive. However, the issue was apparently thought significant enough for a recent Curator to break the Writing into two parts, appending 'redux' to the Title of the second part (the term is of unknown origin; here it seems to mean 'begin again'; compare {Starling redux}). This is appropriate, given the revenance of ancient locutions in this latter segment, a ghostly phenomenon upon which the Scholar cannot help but remark. This sundering of the Scholar's 'apology' (itself an archaic usage) into two Writings has been respected here. Some dispute the Scholar's authorship of the dialogue {hands}, and propose it was adapted from some fragment of the Last One's discourse, or else is an orphan text even more Ancient than he. It is unlikely we will ever know which is the case. Many difficulties are posed by {recovery} &mdash; the only remaining Writing in the Archives attributed to the Scholar &mdash; not least in that it seriously contradicts the experience related in {Scholar's Vision}. It also hints that the Scholar's rediscovery of the Writings of Egderus Scriptor may have played a role, however unintended, in the annihilation of that great institution known as the Temple, as related elsewhere in the Writings of his younger contemporaries, the Unknown Scholastic and the Locust Grove Author. The Writing's provenance cannot be ascertained, and so the only datum arguing for its ascription to this familiar figure in the Archives' history is the fact that its narrator was found on his back in the snow underneath a tree, a well-known event in the Scholar's life. Of course it is possible that the narrator here is not the same person as the Author of the Writing {Scholar's Vision}, a claim made by at least one impatient analyst, who nevertheless puts forth no plausible alternative candidate...","LegomenonforSCHOLAR.html"],

	["Legomenon for Egderus' mentor SUPERIUS FRATER","The title Superius Frater was given to the person in charge of the hermitic community of Mountain House, where Egderus spent much of his youth, and was later assigned the position himself. Egderus' mentor and predecessor in the office left behind two fragmentary documents to piece out the story begun by Egderus in his Testament. In the first of these Writings, {Superius Frater and Robenc}, the Superius Frater describes a dialogue between himself and Praetor Robenc, sometime after the latter left his position as Phylax or chief Guardian of the brothers under the Superius' charge at Mountain House. It forms part of the documentation of the so-called Rescue Plot wherein the Historian was freed from the Good Doctor, who was brought down with the aid of Egderus and Aric, Robenc's Adjutant. The other fragment, here called {Superius Frater's Notes}, contains the Superius' sketches of four persons from this moment of his life, including the Good Doctor, the monstrous Gig (Robenc Robenc's predecessor as Phylax), Robenc himself, and his own 'sweet son', Egderus. Apparently the position of Superius Frater at Mountain House was something of a punitive assignment, according to oblique comments by Egderus and others, but both this Superius and his sweet son accepted their sentence stoically, and endeavored in whatever ways possible to enhance and protect the community they had been called to serve.","LegomenonforSUPERIUSFRATER.html"],
	["Legomenon for Writings from the time of The ANCIENTS","The oldest writings in the Archives are survivors of the utter collapse of the magnificent civilization which flourished before our own. We first meet the Boy who, as a youth, accompanied the Ancient Author known as the Last One, whose own work gives us a hint of how we came into possession of the writings later found by Egderus and bound into a proper archive. These found texts by Unknown Ancients provide glimpses into the liminal period surrounding that apocalypse.","LegomenonfortheANCIENTS.html"],
	["Legomenon for the Author M, sometimes known as The MISSIONARY","The Author of the memoir {Writings of The Missionary} does not name himself except to sign the salutation to his disciples with the character 'M'. The hortatory content of its opening paragraphs has led many to attribute this Writing to the so-called Missionary to the Remnant, a legendary figure who appeared tangentially in the now-lost annals of the Golias from Egderus' time. There is considerable argument over who M actually is. Some identify the Missionary with the Good Doctor, the cruel torturer who appears in some of the Writings of Egderus himself and also of his friend, Praetor Aric. Others believe that the Writings ascribed to him are the contrivance of a later Author, composed perhaps as early as the generation following Egderus &mdash; that is to say, the generation of Markito Scriptor, Egderus' secretary and successor as Curator of the Archives, who has himself been identified by some as the pseudonymous Author 'M'. Further, certain partisans of this latter conjecture assert that Markito may in fact be the Author of all the Writings of Egderus and his contemporaries, not just their Curator. This revolutionary but intriguing notion has yet to win a majority of adherents. Three other texts have come to be credited to this Author. The first of these, entitled {M Part 2} (possibly because of its account of a second meeting with the Historian, under circumstances quite different from those of their first encounter), offers sufficient correspondence with other Writings to be challenged on the basis of being too 'convenient' &mdash; a popular charge among critics who have nothing of their own to contribute to the discourse. The validity of {in the Keep} is somewhat less tenuous: passages in {Testimony of Praetor Aric} echo this one; further, the independent but parallel Writing {Aric: Aftermath} supports giving this Writing to the former Good Doctor. It is very tempting to consider the last of these new Writings, {M the Wanderer}, as the sequel to {in the Keep}, but only because it 'feels' like the logical next step in M's story &mdash; there is no defense for this proposition to be found in the Archives other than such a feeling. The events in this Writing could just as plausibly belong to the narrator of {Peripatikos Soter}, the questSaga attributed to the much later Voice from the Locust Grove, and indeed this theory has some support, but only enough to warrant mentioning it here; the trend of opinion runs more strongly in the direction of the mysterious M.","LegomenonforTheMISSIONARY.html"],
	["Legomenon for the collective Author known as The REMNANT","The people known as the Remnant cannot be positively identified. Three possibilities have been advanced: The Remnant were an aboriginal people. The Remnant were the direct descendants of the Ancients. The Remnant are a figment of someone's imagination. The first two interpretations overlap significantly, depending on how one identifies the Ancients: If the Ancients were deities, as was generally believed during Egderus' era, then the Remnant would be descendants of the First People, who were fashioned, along with the rest of Creation, by the Ancients. At some later point, then, the Remnant became isolated from their civilized cousins, our progenitors. But if the Ancients were mortals like ourselves, then the Remnant were their direct descendants, the survivors of the cataclysm that brought an end to the Ancients' magnificent civilization. This proposal is the foundation of the so-called 'We Descend' heresy. The third interpretation is considered by some to be the most attractive: the Remnant never did exist &mdash; except as a collective fictional character in a complex, multi-generational hoax that, despite many years of vigorous research, has never been entirely discredited. Six Writings in the Archives are generally attributed to the Remnant. The first, here titled {The Remnant Say...}, is also known as 'Proverbs of the Remnant'; however, it seems rather to be a poem (or part of one) on a single subject. Perhaps it is a segment of a longer work containing sayings on other subjects, but this is all that has survived. Notwithstanding vigorous advocacy from certain quarters, there is no certainty that Egderus composed it, however much the burden of the Writing is consistent with what many take to be his philosophy of life. According to one conjecture, the peculiar symbols incribed at the head of certain stanzas of this fragment &mdash; '‡', '‡‡', '‡‡‡', and so on &mdash; seem to be patterans, marking as it were the stepping stones on the path formed by the five separate 'pages' (or perhaps pottery sherds) upon which this most ancient Writing was originally inscribed. Although the second, {Rhapsody}, has been likewise ascribed to Egderus, there is no evidence to support doing so. However, there does seem to be a similarity of tone between this writing and the proverb-like {The Remnant Say...} &mdash; hence its provisional placement here. However, the radical conjecture has also been made that both of these 'Rhapsodies of the Remnant' were actually composed by none other than the Good Doctor, who, after a violent conversion, came to be known as the Missionary to the Remnant. See also scholion {I may not be the first} from the Historian's Notebook. Of the four remaining examples of sayings properly called, two &mdash; {secrets} and {no certainties, no truth} &mdash; could be variants on a theme, derived either from successive Authors or from the same Author at different times. Those remaining, &mdash; {which is at fault?} and {promises and trust} &mdash; seem to be general maxims unrelated to the other two. All four come from a heavily damaged document in which was transcribed an incomplete (or abandoned) collection of such apothegms. Additionally, 'quotations' from the Remnant can be found in Writings from all eras encompassed by the Archives &mdash; a phenomenon easily appreciated by the most casual Reader, and which may have motivated the project of gathering them into a single volume. In a sense, however, the diasporic pattern in which they have been transmitted to us is the provenance of The Remnant and their Sayings, or can at least so serve until the roiling waters of warring theories have somehow been conciliated.","LegomenonfortheREMNANT.html"],
	["Legomenon for UNKNOWN ANCIENTS","As these are the oldest and most fragmentary Writings in the Archives, they all but defy definitive attribution. The first group seem to share a perspective: a desperate circumstance has engulfed the world and has lasted for The distressing {Storms and haze} describes a community paralyzed by foul weather that will not let up; in {Catastrophe}, the narrator casts about for something else to think about; {My despair} provides that topic, for a while, at least... The same person may be speaking in {New Ecclesiastes} though the title is obscure: is 'Ecclesiastes' a person? an event? an institution? And in {Wayfarin' Stranger} &mdash; again perhaps by the same person, a musician &mdash; the narrator dreams of the 'bright world' to come, rejoining lost ones at last, if only, perhaps, after death. Three clearly related fragments, {And as for those that are left}, {For you shall be in league with the stones}, and {The stars shone in their watches}, each contain what appears to be a citation, either of the title of the work from which they were extracted, or else the work's author &mdash; 'Leviticus' in the first Writing, 'Job' in the second, and 'Baruch' in the third. If proper names, they number among the few such in the Archives; none appears anywhere else but in these very brief Writings. Although most of the primary material in the Archives is fragmentary, {Pastoral}, {Fallen}, and {No gifts} are the smallest &mdash; and perhaps the very oldest &mdash; scraps of writing that have been preserved. It has been opined that they are translations or adaptations of even older texts than the rest of the Writings of the Ancients. But this conjecture can, unhappily, only ever be just that. The expression of the Author of {what it is} has proved a challenge to many a curator through the generations of the Archives' transmission. His rage is so intemperate that it sometimes drives his utterance beyond the bounds of intelligibility &mdash; a quality that comes through clearly even in the most sedate or literal rendition &mdash; though for the most part his general meaning can be guessed from context. The peculiar {nothing at all} represents a kind of condensation of the thinking exhibited in a number of Writings from this period, though its sometimes tortuous and recursive syntax can puzzle even the doughtiest of interpreters. But its philosophical burden &mdash; ie, the emptiness of so much of the discourse of the time, can hardly be refuted. The narrative {refugee}, one of the longest in the archives, comes the closest to providing a complete portrait of the end of the world of the Ancients, from the perspective of one in a position to see its immediate aftereffects. In like wise, {this road} helps us appreciate what it must have been like to live that moment: one knows something has gone wrong, investigates, realizes the situation is worse than imagined (or imaginable), then finds a way to face whatever is come.","LegomenonforUNKNOWNANCIENTS.html"],
	["Legomenon for one of the Scholar's successors UNKNOWN CURATOR","The Author of the fragment {archive under threat} has often been identified with the Supplanter addressed in the Writing {Scholar's Farewell}. If this supposition is viable, then the 'conversion' there predicted would seem already to have taken place: this later Curator has evidently lost whatever illusions he might have entertained about the 'benignity of [his] sponsors,' and is bending all his efforts towards shielding his precious charge from the attentions of such men, as the Scholar advised him to do. The Writing itself not only details the ad-hoc methodology of curation more than one transmitter of the Archives was required to adopt, but also evokes the environment of furtiveness and peril that necessitated such tortuous practice. We can easily see why so many Writings are incomplete, given the rough treatment they must have undergone as they passed from curator to curator &mdash; not to mention the neglect they would have suffered during periods when they had to be abandoned, as may have occurred in this instance. For some time it has been generally accepted that it was this Unknown Curator who built the INVENTORY &mdash; which lists the Writings by Author in descending order &mdash; thus creating the first true arrangement of these documents. It has also been proposed, seemingly on the basis of the remark about inserting notae (observe the old spelling), that this person is the Scholiast who provided the commentary scattered throughout the archives. If true, this would mean that it was this copy of the Writings that survived, not the original, the latter of which may have been seized by authorities, who then destroyed it &mdash; or else the original followed a different trajectory altogether in its journey to us.","LegomenonforUNKNOWNCURATOR.html"],
	["Legomenon for Writings of UNKNOWN PROVENANCE","These Writings have proved undatable, even employing the most sophisticated forensic practice, but the consensus of opinion is that they were composed more recently than the work of all other Authors identified in the Archives.

The Writings of the so-called Romantic Impluse Author are the only ones in this timeBand that can plausibly be attributed to a single person; those clustered under the heading Insomniac are understood to have been brought together by a previous Curator with a strong opinion as to their authorship, but no hard proof (if such a thing could possibly exist) has survived their transmission. The Other Writings of Unknown Provenance gathered here are truly the miscellaneous remnant of the rest, which cannot with confidence be placed elsewhere in time. Naturally such uncertainty has proved frustrating for many, but this lacuna in our knowledge of where, when, and how these voices from the past have reached us should not interfere with our engagement with the stories they tell, however disjointedly.

	["Legomenon for UNKNOWN SCHOLASTIC","The lengthy narrative {conspiracy} has proved invaluable in providing a detailed description of life in the Temple School during the last moments of its normal life. It also portrays the immediate, pragmatic impact of the so-called 'We Descend' heresy (ie that the Ancients were not deities, but ordinary mortals like ourselves) on the political life of the Conference to whom the Scholar presented his discovery of the Archives, as well as some elements of their post-Temple transmission to us. In addition, it tentatively links its narrator to the Author known as Locust Grove Author, and from this connection has encouraged some to propose at least one 'resting place' for the Archives after they were rescued from the destruction of the Temple: up in the head of a huge bell where presumably this Author secreted them for preservation until their rescue &mdash; by his unknown successor, whom he could only imagine and wish for, but never know.","LegomenonforUNKNOWNSCHOLASTIC.html"],
	["Legomenon for VOICE from the LOCUST GROVE","It is unusual (and unusually valuable) when two Authors in the Archives corroborate one another's accounts: where their descriptions of events agree, we can take them as having happened as described; where they differ, we can evaluate each narrative in the light of the other, thereby enlarging our understanding, not only of their authors' motivations, but also of the context out of which they speak. Such is the case between this Author and the Scholar who discovered the Archives, the latter of whom is without doubt the drunken man who appears suddenly in the place which gives the former a name. In the first of this Author's Writings, {The Locust Grove}, probably written years after the events it recounts, the narrator witnesses what appears to be the immediate aftermath of the Scholar's audience with the Council, during which his work was confiscated and he was dismissed from the Conference. The speaker is shaken by this scene, an inner event that bears fruit much later. The next, {The Retreat House} would seem to be a sequel, which may well once have been contiguous with its predecessor narrative. This harrowing tale is without precedent in the archives, and some dubious critics have proposed that it is the evil fantasy &mdash; or, to be generous, an hallucination &mdash; of a mind unhinged. Be that as it may, the remaining documents ascribed to this Author bespeak a benison that nearly unbearable suffering &mdash; real or imagined, it must be said &mdash; sometimes grants its subject. In {midnight_pain}, which seems to be a composite document, the sufferer finds comfort and even solace from an unlikely source; {The Man in the Moon} is a mere scrap, but its compressed image has great power; while {Peripatikos Soter}, whose opening paragraphs are much damaged (or deranged), finally confers upon the narrator an unlooked-for blessing &mdash; a totally improbable one, say the skeptics, as is their wont in such situations. One is tempted to respond, As the Remnant say, Refusing to believe protects you from nothing. This very peculiar Writing invites further consideration. As with each of the Romantic Impulse Writings, this text may be an unfinished draft or collection of sketches never completed, or whose finished version has since been lost. It is included here because of the obvious importance of the tale it tells: it definitively proposes that the Locust Grove Author later became one of the Curators of the Archives, who dug out of the ruins of the Temple the materials that were originally discovered and collected by the Scholar, which were then confiscated after his disastrous presentation to the Convention. Nowhere else in the Archives is such direct evidence of transmission to be found: in all other cases, it must be hypothesized (or merely asserted) that such&such a person received the Archives from such&such another. Naturally, many questions arise. When and how was the Temple destroyed? In what form did this Rescuer transmit the Archives, after working on them for an unknown period and to an unknown extent &mdash; and to whom? The history and mechanism of the Archives' transmission from this Author's era to our own is even more murky than that from Egderus' time to the Scholar's, because both Egderus and the Scholar give clues, however indistinct, as to what was retrieved and what was passed on. And what is the provenance of the bizarre Title of this Writing, and who is responsible for it? 'Peripatikos'? 'Soter'? No convincing etymology has been proposed for either word, as they are unique to the Archives, and may represent a retrieval from an ancient (or secret) language as yet unknown to us. One suggestion has been to analogize it to the nams 'Egderus Scriptor', so that 'Soter' could be a cognomen, and here might mean Rescuer or Savior of the Archives &mdash; if the whole Title of the Writing is the Author's denomination rather than a descriptor of the story it tells. On the other hand, it has been suggested, on the basis of the kind of life this person leads, that 'Peripatikos' &mdash; rather than being a given name such as 'Egderus' or 'Markito' &mdash; is a sort of 'occupational' name, and could denote 'wanderer', vagabond', or even 'vagrant', someone without employment or position within civilized society &mdash; and further, in the instance of this particular person, someone who indeed shuns such a position as an odious entanglement, or in any case has little interest in (re)joining such a world. For a fuller treatment of this subject in a Writing sometimes also attributed to this unknown Author, see {The Land Where No Man Is}. Finally, the fragmentary {only I can do} is the last Writing in the Archives to be positively identified as coming from the Locust Grove Author. Some of this narrative's elements are echoed in the more recent {conspiracy} by an Unknown Scholastic who may have known this Author well. The supposition that this Author actively transmitted the Archives to that former colleague can only be that, a guess based mainly upon a heartfelt wish on our part that it be so.","LegomenonforVOICEfromtheLOCUSTGROVE.html"],

	["Manhunter Moon","They call it Manhunter Moon. A group of elder men has welcomed me &mdash; I learned that they meet occasionally at an inn near my room. I had taken to sitting there, outside, under the trees, but had never seen another customer at such an early hour. And so this morning I could not help but notice when one after another gray-haired gentleman walked up the path, went inside, and stayed. Eventually, one of them came back out and approached me, asking a question. At first I did not understand what he wanted, but through his gestures and friendly expression I soon determined that he was inviting me to join him, and when I followed him inside I saw the entire group sitting around two tables pushed together in the small dining hall. They made room for me, and I sat down next to my new acquaintance. Then each put his hand on his breastbone, and with a slight nod spoke a word that must have been his name, and so I did the same &mdash; not my real name, of course, but a nickname I have not used since childhood, and that no one living would ever know once belonged to me. They then resumed their conversation, which was spirited and full of joking at each other's expense, in the way men everywhere seem to enjoy when no women are present. My grasp of their language is weak, but I was soon caught up in the cheerful mood of the company, laughing along with them, thinking how long it has been since I was able to do that. The meal was delightful, and when it was over, no one would let me pay my portion of the cost, which embarrassed and worried me, but I could not change their minds. In the end the group broke up into twos and threes, and soon I was alone again, having promised, I think, to meet them once more the next time they gather, whenever that will be. One part of the conversation did stay with me, for with their help I came to understand it well enough: the name of the moon I watched hang over the mountain this morning as the dawn came up &mdash; Manhunter Moon. In the moment, it did not seem any more than a topic of casual discussion. It is the time when the moon is full, after all, and just now it seems unusually large, especially near the horizon. But my fellows &mdash; or, now I think about it more attentively, just those few closest to me &mdash; were quite earnest that I learn the name of this particular moon: Man. Hunted. Under such a Moon. Back in my room, I began to doubt that this was just some innocent item of local lore they were trying to impress upon me. In my fugitive state, it is dangerous for me to relax my vigilance in any way, at least not until I know more about this place &mdash; especially the contact and relations it has with other communities nearby, about which I know almost nothing. Should any of my pursuers get to hear of this pleasant gathering, it will be the end of my stay here, one way or another. If I learn of them before they learn of me &mdash; and indeed, my new friends may have been trying to warn me in some obscure fashion &mdash; I may be able to get away; if not, then I will leave here by other means. I doubt that I can weather another desperate escape &mdash; the effort that brought me here in the first place nearly finished me &mdash; and it may happen that I will just let my enemies take me this time, since, weary as I am, it seems inevitable anyway. They are many and I am one; they work in concert, while I am alone and know no one, nor can I ever return to any familiar place again. It feels as if I left my home long ago, and yet I have been in flight only something less than a year, though how many moons have looked impassively down upon my exile I can no longer say. It was high summer when I abandoned everything I knew &mdash; but here the seasons are different, and I cannot tell what time of year it is. However, writing these things calms me, and I begin to regain some heart. I may not be safe &mdash; no one is ever safe, anywhere, except for a time &mdash; but for this time at least I have the time to remember better times, and be grateful for whatever happiness I knew then. Thinking this makes me wish that the same happiness comes to my new friends, and then to their friends, and so on out to every living thing that creepeth upon the earth, as the man I called my Grampa used to say. I would object, when he said this, that not everything creepeth upon the earth: birds fly through the air, and fish swim in the sea &mdash; and he would reply, 'You are right! let us bring them into our wish as well!' and so we'd go on, naming every creature I could think of: the birds that flieth, the fish that swimmeth; the wolves that runneth, and the rabbits that hoppeth; the trees that waveth and the flowers that bloometh and the rivers that floweth and the winds that bloweth, until I could think of no other -eths, and then we would shout, LET IT BE SO! It is now afternoon, and the face of the mountain opposite me is edging into shadow, as the sun soars beyond it toward its disappearing place. This morning, from almost the same position, old Manhunter Moon looked into my room; whether he could not see me sitting in the dark with the sun in his eyes, or saw me perfectly well and decided to let me go, at least for today, I feel somehow blessed by this place, which may as well be my disappearing place as any other that sitteth upon the earth. And I say, whatever is to come, LET IT BE SO!","ManhunterMoon.html"],
	["Man in the Moon","It has been postulated that the Ancients saw a face in the moon's disk, and that the 'Man in the Moon' appeared as a character in numerous legends and children's stories, often as a bogle to frighten them into obedience, but sometimes as a manifestation of the Raggedy Man in his role as secret ally. Allegedly, in one of these tales, discovered in a section of the Archives containing little more than scraps (but subsequently lost), the Man in the Moon was a Great Criminal, whose punishment was to wander the sky forever, never to find a home.","ManintheMoon.html"],

	["midnight_pain","Once, in the middle of the night, she came to me. It was early in my convalescence, a terrible time when all my injuries fully manifested themselves, and their treatment often entailed the most exquisite agony. The doctor explained that my spine had been bruised, and the nerves were swelling in such a way that I felt first a tingling, then a burning, and finally a bone-deep ache down both arms, shoulder to fingertips. It would heal of itself, he told me, but it might be a long time, perhaps months, before I could use my hands normally again. I had been given an anodyne at bedtime, but its effect faded long before it should have, leaving me writhing on my cot. I may have cried out for help; certainly my groaning and thrashing disrupted the sleep of the few others in the dormitory. I got up and went out into the day room, with the intent of walking off the pain if I could. Not surprisingly this brought little relief, and may have made matters worse. But there was no point in returning to bed, and pacing back and forth at least gave me something to do. After a long while, there appeared, in the dim light beyond the threshold of the surgery, a figure in a long robe and hood. The shape moved closer, and I backed away, uncertain if I had invoked some demon of the night to torment me further, or else the Companion had come to conduct me out of this world. But then the hood was drawn back to reveal the face of my nurse, her hair unfastened, eyes still puffy from sleep. Somehow, I had never thought to picture her as an ordinary soul who wore a night dress in order to sleep in a bed, and the look that must then have crossed my face seemed to cause her own expression to soften towards me in that moment. ++++++++++++++++++++++++ Patient is a gifted storyteller, and indulges this gift at every opportunity. But there is no possibility that the dreadful wounds sustained by this young person are self-inflicted. The true events and conditions issuing in these injuries are of no concern to me or to the doctor, except insofar as our knowing them can help us do our work. Still... ++++++++++++++++++++++++ She led me into the surgery, where she lit a fire under the kettle. I could only gaze at her, unable to speak, as she went about preparing an infusion of bark tea. When it was ready, she opened a cabinet with a key suspended from a sturdy but beautiful chain around her neck, and took out a tiny bottle with a glass stopper; to the potion she then added a single drop from the phial, which she replaced and locked securely in the cabinet again. The tea was bitter, but had a wholesome aftertaste that spread warmth through my body as if I were being lowered into a hot bath. The nurse smiled to see my reaction, her face still gentle from recent rising. Soon the pain lost its savage sharpness, and I was able to move my arms with some ease again. She asked if I was ready to go back to sleep; I replied that I was exhausted, but also felt reluctant to disturb my fellows in the dormitory with my restless noise. She appeared to consider for a moment, then took my hand and opened the door to what I'd thought must be a linen closet, and indeed the room beyond was tiny. But against the far wall was a true bed &mdash; not a cot or hammock &mdash; rough-hewn and small, but with a mattress and two pillows in addition to the bedclothes which she had recently thrown aside to come to my relief. It was an uncertain moment: her generous gesture could so easily have been misinterpreted, were anyone to learn of it, but I do believe there was more to her intention than professional concern for my comfort. There was also no danger of impropriety, on my part at least, given the condition of my injuries. So I lay down upon her bed, and sank into the warmth of her smell as she covered me with her blankets and went to sit at the little desk out in the surgery, where she opened a ledger and began to write by the light of a candle. In moments I must have fallen asleep, and the next morning awoke upon my cot in the dormitory, knowing nothing of how I had returned thither. In the days that followed, I saw more than once that same measuring look in her eyes as she attended the doctor's examination of his patients. This led me to believe that what I had experienced that night was no mere vision of delirium, and in time this impression was confirmed when she asked me, as she changed my pillowslip after just such a visit from the doctor, if I was still having difficulty sleeping. I responded that the single application of her potion &mdash; or perhaps her unexpected kindness &mdash; had been enough to banish my sleeplessness ever since, and indeed the only dreams I remembered were suffused with calm joy. I saw that it took some effort for her not to smile, but she was clearly not a person much susceptible to flattery. She said she was happy to hear it, then chaffed me solemnly that I should continue to dream so if I could. ++++++++++++++++++++++++ Patient's suffering lessens day by day; the question now arises: How long...? ++++++++++++++++++++++++ I cannot escape the feeling that my nurse is waiting for me to say or do something &mdash; or for some development in my condition that has yet to take place. The latter would be the logical explanation for this feeling; but I somehow believe the former is the case. If so, I am unsure what it is she wants from me. Our midnight meeting has not been repeated, though more than once I have long lain awake, trying to decide whether to get up and go to the day room again, to see if she would reappear as before. I have not done so, of course; I feel it would be dishonest: my pain no longer agonizes me; indeed, my medication has been reduced with no ill effect. In a short while, I know, I will be released, and go on to whatever life I can make for myself in what remains to me of the world I was driven from that night. This notion makes me think that perhaps I am waiting for something from her: but what? a valediction? some kind of blessing upon the journey I must now take? She knows what was done to me &mdash; that much can be deduced from my injuries. It would hardly be difficult for a thoughtful person to wonder how I came to be the only survivor of that annihilation. How could such a wretched creature as myself expect any blessing from anyone, ever again, let alone from the angel of mercy she is to me? And yet, I realize, that is exactly what I await from her. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Patient's injuries are healing well, but a pall of sadness and anxiety seems to have taken hold of this poor young person. I fear that unless something is done to relieve this burden, no combination of medicaments will bring about a recovery. This spiritual affliction is not uncommon in those who survive when others around them perish; if that is so in this case, it will not be within our power to effect relief &mdash; rather, such persons must turn away from sorrow of their own accord.","midnight_pain.html"],

	["More Writings!","More writings have come into my possession. I can only describe them as astounding, enough so that my original suspicion of forgery has been reawakened. In the first place, some of them explain &mdash; rather too conveniently, I feel &mdash; gaps in the story as I had originally reconstructed it, almost as if the characters, hearing that they were being unfairly or incompletely represented to (or by) me, had come forward to speak for themselves. In particular, Egderus, in these additional writings, begins to impress me as overinsistent on his own righteousness, at least in regard to his collusion in the escape of the Historian. But most intriguing is the so-called Historian's portrait of his rescuers, whose identity remains a mystery. I can think of only three possibilities to account for them: They were an aboriginal people. were the direct descendants of the Ancients. are a figment of someone's imagination.   ‡ An Aboriginal People This interpretation is in some ways the most attractive because the least controversial. In recent explorations of the frontier, several groups of previously unknown peoples have been encountered, and often their cultures differed significantly from our own. True, their language and many of their customs have subsequently been found to relate to ours, suggesting that originally our two peoples were a single clan that somehow became separated over the generations. But it is not impossible to conceive of an unknown race or even species inhabiting the much more extensive wilderness of Egderus' time, whose only contacts with his world, prior to their extinction, had been infrequent and fleeting. Should this be the case, we would need to recast Egderus' statements of fact as instead being suppositions, perhaps fanciful conjectures, that were based on the beliefs of his times, about which I must reassert we know very little. ‡‡ Descendants of the Ancients This is the interpretation that the Archives, taken as a whole, tend to support. If the Archives are genuine, it is a hard task to dismiss this reading of the evidence. As I indicated, the conclusions proceeding from this interpretation are troubling. It means nothing less than that the Ancients, far from being divinities, as we have been assuming was the belief in Egderus' time &mdash; a widespread conviction even up to the present day &mdash; but rather creatures at the very best no different from ourselves in our bodily nature. According to this hypothesis, some monstrous catastrophe befell their civilization (or was brought on by themselves), and the Remnant &mdash; at least as outlined in the more or less reliable sources (that is, discounting the almost certainly spurious 'Historian's Notebook') &mdash; perforce went 'back to nature', under the harshest imaginable conditions, and for generations &mdash; that is, a period of time sufficient to completely efface all but the vaguest memory of the glory of that civilization. It also means that the Ancients actually did exist. ‡‡‡ A Figment of Someone's Imagination In another way, this is the most tempting interpretation, especially for anyone of a skeptical nature. In fact, I shouldn't be surprised if some of my more dubious auditors conclude that the entire Archive is of my own composition! Of course that is not true, but it is possible that someone else has composed some, or most, or even all of these documents with the idea of perpetrating a hoax on our scholarly world, selecting me as chief dupe. Should that prove to be the case, I shall be utterly ruined, first of all for my own gullibility, and secondly for being the instrument &mdash; insofar as I persuade anyone to believe me &mdash; by which my entire community is exposed to ridicule.   Naturally I find this last interpretation the least congenial of the three. First, my vanity prohibits me from conceiving myself as being so credulous: despite my lack of significant acclaim, I have made a solid contribution to the increase of knowledge, and my apprenticeship was completed long ago. Although it is theoretically possible for me to be fooled, it cannot be done so easily. Second, who would do such a thing? And why? And why choose me, of all people, to be cat's paw? And finally, I am persuaded by these voices (or some of them!) from long ago. To be honest, I know of no way to actually prove the authenticity of all or any of these writings, and the only way to disprove their authenticity is to produce the hoaxer(s) who composed them, an unlikely prospect at best. No: I have spent the emotional and spiritual equivalent of years of my life with these people, and I believe in them &mdash; whether they existed or not, I am surprised to say. And I am also convinced that others who follow will find themselves persuaded by these stories, if I can somehow present them fairly.","MoreWritings.html"],

	["M Part 2","My first encounter with the so-called Historian was not my last, but when we met a second time our situations were nearly reversed: his life was in my hand, and I was closing that hand into a fist. This disgraceful tale begins, little children, with an event no one could have foreseen: the conversion of the Golias. The story told was that the Golias had a vision: during a desperate battle to defend our homeland, an angelic being appeared to him, bearing one of the sacred symbols of our faith, and told him to adopt this symbol for his banner; when he did so, the tide of the battle turned miraculously against our enemies, whom he then overthrew and annihilated. Upon returning in glory to Golia, he struck down the ban under which we had been persecuted for so many years. Although his belief was fervent, he knew little of our origins, rituals, and tenets. The Eparch himself undertook to instruct the Golias in the fundamentals of our creed, and, if you will believe it, appointed me to do the same for the Inquirer General, who enforced proper reverence for the Deities. The Eparch was enormously excited by this development, for he felt sure that now not only would we be able to worship as we were called to do, but we could spread the good news throughout the realms of the Golias without fear of retribution. He had dreamed of this day, he told me, and had many plans. His enthusiasm was irresistible &mdash; I never saw such change in a man: what was once a quiet, overcautious hoarder of hard-fought privileges became a bold, almost reckless crusader on a mission to convert the world. Had I known then what I know now, I might have said he acted in terror that his good fortune would not last... When I met the Inquirer General, his first act was to kneel before me and confess that it was he who was responsible for the torture and execution of my beloved Master, for which he humbly begged my forgiveness. I was not prepared for this stratagem &mdash; and that was all it was, of course &mdash; but afterwards I understood well enough that, at the very beginning of the game, he had trapped me before I could make a move. Today, I believe that the only safe thing I could have done, in that moment of my life, was to turn and run, and to keep running and running, until I had run so far from that corrupt and savage world that I could never find it again. But the moment passed, and I did not run. Instead I asked myself, and do so still, what would that accomplish? except to squander whatever gifts I possessed for bringing great good to others, as I fervently longed to do. Vanity, little children. My new master was very curious about the specific beliefs of our faith, and he required me to go over and over certain points of doctrine in great detail. He explained that this was necessary in order to be certain that, when we contended with an unrepentant heretic, we were always strictly in the right, because the penalties were severe for refusing to respect the deities, and especially for spreading wicked ideas about them &mdash; as well I knew, he reminded me &mdash; and we must take every possible precaution to avoid wrongly imposing them upon an innocent person. You will have noticed that I say 'we'. The Eparch had appointed me only as an advisor to the Inquirer General &mdash; in theory, the Eparch was still my master &mdash; but over time it simply came to be understood that in reality I served the Inquirer General. And in time I was obliged to witness, and then to conduct, what were called Interviews of Clients, but were in fact interrogations, which could become quite harsh. One day followed another with not much change: each morning I went to the Office of Inquiry and performed my work; each evening I returned to my quarters and slept; one decision led to the next, and the next, and the next. Thus it was, little children, that, by inches and by hours, as the Remnant say, I became something I abominated, but could never quite see my way clear to the decisive act that would stop my slide into iniquity. Of course, this is how I see it now. For the most part it never occurred to me then that I was doing anything but laboring for the good. I cannot think of one particular instance in which I felt it necessary to examine my conscience, even when inflicting agony upon another person: I persuaded myself that any action was justified if it promised to lead to the desired outcome, which was the unity of the faithful. And our faith did in fact prosper and spread throughout the domains of the Golias, just as the Eparch had hoped. Years passed, and then the Golias suddenly died; some whispered that he was murdered in a coup. Whatever really happened, there followed a violent struggle for the succession; finally his younger son &mdash;the dark-eyed man I had met my first day in Golia &mdash; gained the upper hand and restored order to the realm, which he achieved with singular savagery. In the course of the battle for his father's throne, the new Golias had become a convert to our faith &mdash; complete with the new convert's zeal and intolerance. Specifically, once he had consolidated his power, he decreed the expulsion of what he called 'schism-causers', and directed that the Office of Inquiry take charge of this task. The Eparch survived the purge that followed the accession, though I was never to see him again. The Inquirer General simply disappeared. I was reassigned to Mountain House, a remote cenobitic community watched over by a small garrison of soldiers. My duties were trifling: I acted as Prior to the Superius Frater, a bitter man with grandiose delusions of his real importance in the world, who loathed his job, despised the brothers under his ostensible safekeeping, and in particular hated me &mdash; it was no secret that he regarded me as a spy imposed upon him by the new Golias. Only one creature in the entire community did this odious man seem to trust, and that was a servile little toady named Egderus, whose true relationship with his abbas was impossible not to infer. Incredible as it is even now to conceive, this despicable young man became my savior. Egderus was a prodigy of ruination. He first secured the horrific murder of the commander of the garrison, a terrifying monster of a man named Gig, then set in motion the assassination of his erstwhile benefactor, the Superius Frater. I knew nothing of Egderus' criminal proclivities until after I became his victim myself. It was, however, his sabotage of my career that brought me to you, little children. In this respect I owe him the deepest gratitude. After three years of wretchedness at Mountain House, I was recalled to the Office of Inquiry, and given a higher position than the one I had left: I was made Prior over all Examiners, second only to the new Inquirer General himself. This man was a remote, fastidious bureaucrat whose loyalty to the new Golias was total and inflexible. He had but one directive for me to enforce: secure the application of doctrine. The Examiners under my authority were given no license to interpret in any way the findings of the interviews they conducted. That was my responsibility; I was given charge over determining the penalty to be imposed upon all deviants from the true way. Although the Superius Frater at Mountain House had tried to oppose my transfer &mdash; for reasons I cannot imagine, other than sheer perversity &mdash; he yet retained enough influence to require that I take Egderus with me. I believe he wished only to promote his young protégé's career; or he may have rightly suspected that Egderus had evil intentions toward him, and was trying to remove the source &mdash; which, in the event, only delayed the unavoidable. Egderus did write a pretty hand, so he was useful as a secretary, but I never trusted him enough to employ him as my sole assistant, and restricted his duties to the merest clerical work. Despite my taking significant precautions against his meddling, however, Egderus connived to gain access to the full archives of the Office, and I believe it was on this basis that he brought about my downfall. Perhaps inevitably, it one day came about that a Procedure was initiated against the self-styled Historian, my former opponent in debate, who had apparently fallen out of favor with the Young Golias, now that the latter was in power. I myself considered the charges against him nugatory; however, no Examiner seemed capable of persuading him to confess his error, and thereby free himself from our attentions. I took over the case in order to settle it quickly, and for the first and only time brought Egderus with me as scriptor &mdash; there being none other available &mdash; to what I was sure would be my only Interview with the Historian. The man's condition had decayed since our previous meeting; he did not recognize me at first, but seemed struck by Egderus, for a reason I could never divine &mdash; there was certainly nothing about the boy's appearance to recommend him to anyone's notice, except for the fact that he was deformed and limped badly &mdash; from a childhood injury, I was told. In any case, Egderus was not slow to perceive the Historian's interest in him, and soon, when he thought I wasn't looking, began making moony eyes at him. It was true that the Historian still retained a few shreds of his former raffish appeal, although, as I said, it was much degraded, but, for certain susceptible types, that only makes such people irresistible. I was immediately angry with myself for not foreseeing that this would happen with Egderus. The Historian mulishly rejected the proposition that he should confess anything: he had done nothing wrong, he said, and disdained to tell a lie just so we could clear our books. And then he realized who I was, and addressed Egderus directly. 'Did you know,' he said insolently, 'that your Master and I are old friends? Well, old debating partners, anyway, in the courts of our beloved Golias, when he was but a princeling.' I felt Egderus go still beside me. 'I always hoped,' he said, turning back to me, 'that we could resume our suspended disputation. I must say,' he continued, before I could stop him, 'that what impressed everyone even more than your skill in opposing me was your integrity. What happened to that?' Without thinking I signaled the Rectifier to break his thumbs. I saw instantly that I had made the misstep we were all warned against in our earliest training as Examiners, the fatal action that solidifies the Client's resistance, after which no means of persuasion can possibly work. And it made an implacable enemy of Egderus, whose talent for treachery I all too soon would measure to the full. I stood and watched my adversary writhe upon the floor, while I wrestled with myself to keep from having him flogged as well. When at last I brought my temper under control, I said, as mildly as I could, 'Very well. Where did we leave off...?' He could do nothing but shriek, as much in horror as in pain, which is of course the purpose of the maneuver. I assumed a puzzled expression. 'I don't recall that topic. Indeed, my memory of the meeting to which you refer is very dim. Perhaps you could remind me of the circumstances?' Beside me Egderus was becoming agitated, and I saw he was going to be sick, so I sent him from the room. Then I turned back to the Historian. 'But you are hurt. We will continue our conversation later. I am upset that this misunderstanding has persisted for so long. Let us resolve it as soon as we can.' The Rectifier wrenched him to his feet. 'Gently, my friend,' I said to him, but he paid no attention, and threw the man bodily out the door. With mixed feelings I listened to the Historian's screams as he was dragged away.","MPart2.html"],
	["M the Wanderer","I know not how long I wandered in that wilderness. A persistent impression in my memory is of standing in my soiled night garment before a brutish man at a table. I can see the man's breath when he speaks, but I shiver so violently I cannot hear him. A scriptor sits beside the man, scribbling ceaselessly in a book, even though I say nothing &mdash; I open my mouth to speak, but no sound comes out, no words form in my mind, I cannot comprehend what he is asking me. What I do understand is that the two guards behind me will wrench off my arms at a mere nod from the man at the table. I sense that the man does not want answers from me; he is playing with me, like a cat with a bird; he only wants me to know I am wholly at his mercy, and that he has none. In some way I cannot explain, this is a source of hope.   Later... I stand on a low rise, gazing out across an ocean of tall golden grass. Gradually, far out in the waves that sweep the vast plain, I perceive the soft outlines of long-fallen walls, the stumps of snapped-off posts and roof-beams: the ruins of an ancient settlement, abandoned long ago. The grass in the valley is half again taller than I, and I know I will lose my bearings nearly at once if I go down into it. But I am drawn to the bones of those ancient buildings, and the next moment I am submerged in the sea of grass. The heat closes over me; I cannot breathe. The sky above the grasstops is failing. I hear myself say, I am going to die here. To my surprise, this brings me peace.   And then... I am in a room packed with objects, stacked on shelves that cover the walls, crammed into cases all over the floor. Under high narrow windows in the far wall, two workbenches are placed, long side towards me, one in front of the other, like counters in a shop. Both are piled with hand tools and complex devices whose purpose I cannot guess. I become aware of a silvery noise: tinkling, whirring, rhythmic ticking and tocking, an occasional quiet thump. Threading through it, the humming of a human voice, riding as it were upon the consort of mechanistical instruments. A man stands between the two benches, his broad back to me, at work on a project his body obscures from view. His hair and beard are black, his skin swarthy and weathered. Directly he straightens; he looks over his shoulder, then turns full round to face me. His countenance lights up and he opens his arms, as if, though I have never been here before, he has expected my return for years.   Whatever linked these impressions has broken &mdash; well, I am their connection, I link them, in this story I am telling now. But the part of myself that actually made the journey from one place to another &mdash; as you might say, the part of me that persists between departing and arriving &mdash; that self has been lost, if it even exists or ever did. My life is like a collection of stepping stones, ripped up from an old path, heaped in the corner of an abandoned yard. These fragments of memory may have been dreams, or phantasies, or the visions that rise in the mind upon hearing &mdash; or reading &mdash; a story told by another. I have, just now, here, made a path for them, by laying them down, one after the other, in the order I have told them &mdash; which has seemed, at this moment, and for this purpose, the best arrangement I can make. But, like the flat stones stacked in the yard, picked one by one and laid down to form a path, they themselves are not changed by being so placed, or disposed, or positioned. The story they tell together, however &mdash; which is an understanding, of each and of all, is it not? &mdash; may not be the same, in a different relation.   Let me recount one more vision to you, little children &mdash; the one that brought me to you....   ... uphill and down, over sharp rocks and smooth sand, through the forest, by the sea...   For many days now an evil smell dogs me; even when I cross the river, the reek grows only stronger. At last I reach the top of a long slope; from the peak I look over and behold an immense space, blanketed with the bodies of the dead. I look from one to the next &mdash; women and men, old and young, large and small: some lie peacefully as if asleep &mdash; but then I see a crow strut across the chest of a woman nearby; another perches on the forehead of the man next to her, picking at the eye-sockets. Beyond them a corpse one or two or three days old, swollen up, blue-black, crawling with worms and further yet a framework of bones, spattered with blood, held together by fraying sinews I turn round and round &mdash; bones scattered in all directions; bleached white like shells; raked up and piled together, weathered, crumbling to dust. I stop, and see, and then say to myself &mdash; 'This body of mine has also this nature, this fate, cannot escape it.' Yet the place is full of living things: tall straight trees with writhen thorny attendants, every hue and shape of flower, bees visiting blossom after blossom, bestowing alms, deep sky arching over us all. And everywhere the noise of birds, the savage cries of carrion-eaters, the delicate trilling of the wren, the sad sentence of the melancholy thrush. All life is gathered here, settled among the dead, at last safe in harbor with them. As the Remnant say: ... the sailor home from sea, and the hunter home from the hill. The charnel ground of the World. Turning again, I no longer see the way I came; here and there I make out others of my state, who sit, or stand, or slowly move about. They do not look at me, nor do they even seem to know that I am here &mdash; and I begin to wonder if I myself am the ghost of one newly died, lingering here for a moment before traveling on... Then the clouds thicken, and the wind picks up, stirring the putrid air exhaled by so many corpses &mdash; and I know I am in the body still. The sky blackens now, the first drops of rain fall on my upturned face, and a long jag of lightning pierces the horizon. Behind the lightning, a peal of thunder, echoing in my brain like a voice, a single word, over and over: 'Beloved. Beloved. Beloved.' Lightning strikes again and again, stepping closer, the rain pelts down now in huge drops that hurt where they hit. Each flash is blinding, but as my eyes adjust, an image emerges in the clouds louring on me: a dark woman, posed as if dancing in the sky, wearing a necklace of skulls, adorned with bones. It is she who is speaking the word in the thunder, saying to me, again and again, 'Beloved. Beloved. Beloved.'","MtheWanderer.html"],
	["My despair","They used to alarm me, these children, these young animals, with their doll's eyes. They grab at each other, they snarl and snap, they hate everyone and are terrified of everything. What alarms me is their blankness, their lack of &mdash; a soul, for want of a better word. They have no faces you can read to tell one from the other. But who would want to stand out, to lead, in a herd like this? in a world like this? They all want to hide. I cannot blame them. To hide, not to die. There is little despair any more. The last person to die from that unbearable condition did so a long time ago. He was my age, we were the last two left for a while, and now he too is gone... We weren't exactly friends; he disgusted me, to tell the truth. But when there are only two of anything, they become of interest and import to each other, sooner or later. His despair was not beautiful, or even clear &mdash; the kind that so inspired me and my dear ones when we were young. We believed we had attained to the finest despair ever achieved by civilized humanity. Without imminent apocalypse, despair can only be a kind of quirk, an eccentricity, a lifestyle choice, to use that hideous expression. The world was never that bad until our time, or so we believed. In my lifetime the world became final, end-of-sentence, last word, last syllable. Then silence. To not feel that great crescendo, that certainty, at the end, was to have gone over the edge already. I didn't appreciate it at the time. I loved my despair, it kept me alive, I had to see the end. Everyone was the same: waiting, rapt...","Mydespair.html"],

I spent yesterday trying to remember who said, 'Those who are ignorant of history are condemned to repeat it.' Who cares who said it? You see the awkwardness of my position. History used to be a question of finding out, not remembering. You read books, you studied with a teacher, you watched enactments with performers in costumes. Occasionally, after slogging through lists of names and dates and places, you entered the realm of the historian's delight: you got the feel of a time and place long ago and far away, you came to know at least one man or woman who lived there and then. All over now. Every time is over now, every place infinitely remote. With no past, what's the present? In a shapeless present, what future can there be? Nobody knew what hit us. In fact, I am one of the last ones who was here when we got hit. The world, such as it is, is made of children now. They weren't here to get hit. Their parents were, some of them. All the parents are dead. I only am escaped alone to tell thee. And who art thou? What is thy worth? Who cares? The kids don't. I'm not a historian, or wasn't before. I am a musician, or used to be. But music went the way of history. Music was sound under control, given shape. History was the mess and redundance of life made understandable. Gone now. Noise and mess, all that's left. Who cares? That's what the kids say. What the kids cannot know is before. The past will never be in front of them, for them to look at, to see. That's what's gone.

	["New Year","In those times, each of us performed a ritual on the first day of the year, alone or with a helper if we had one: before dawn, we would go to the spring and fill a large jug, then bring it back to the room. After washing all over in the icy water, we would quickly put on our best robe, and solemnly carry what remained in the jug out into the common room where it would be joined with that of the rest, in a silent ceremony that signified the sharing of our life with each other. After that, the celebration and feasting would begin! When I myself was first brought to the House, an elderly but energetic lay brother was assigned to be my helper. He told me he had served there since before he was my age, and it was evident that the New Year celebration still excited him as much as if he were that young boy. My first New Year morning, he was gone to the spring while I still slept, and came back before anyone else in the House was even out of bed. Just as he was pouring the water for me to wash, we heard a man singing in the courtyard below. My helper's face filled with joy, for he recognized the voice, he said: it was a beggar who wandered the countryside, singing antic songs and writing poems on the trunks of trees and the sides of mountains. The sky was still dark, but the courtyard glowed with lanterns hung from the balustrade of the gallery, and when we went out and looked down, we could see the odd man clearly. His face sparkled in the lamplight, for he wore a cloth mask with shells and bits of glass sewn into it. He also had on leggings and a skin wrapped around his shoulders, and he capered about, waving a crooked stick in time with his singing. It took a moment for me to comprehend the words he sang, for his accent was unusual, but I understood his song to go something like this: The Old Year dies, the New Year dawns, We mourn, we rejoice &mdash; Can't we just sit still? The earth is round, the earth is flat; It's covered with peaks, but is full of holes &mdash; Why can't it make up its mind? The wind blows, the snow falls, The peaks burst open and leak all over. The rain falls, the wind blows, The holes gargle and sing like they're mad &mdash; What a racket, What a mess! What a glory! What a shame! But wait! Look! The clouds thin away, the wind lies down. All is calm. All is bright. Light from the stars spreads like mist, The dark sky embraces us, rocks us to sleep. Hush! Hush! All gone!

	["On impatience and the enemy","[Editorial note: the following technical discussions were provided by a former Curator with a special interest in the discourse of the Last One.] On {impatience}: Impatience blows the trumpet for the Advent of the ghosts. The earliest interpretation of this cryptic saying, that it is a fragment from a longer allegorical work &mdash; a pageant or historical enactment, perhaps set to music &mdash; is almost certainly wrong. No context for such a performance can be derived from any Writing in the Archives, not to mention the torsion required to credit this construal's absurd claim: that 'the ghosts' were some kind of lesser deities &mdash; even mortals raised to godly rank after death! &mdash; who served as messengers between the divine Ancients and the human world. Such an imaginative explanation likely arose before any other Writings of the Last One were discovered or attributed. (Among the Authors in the Archives, the Last One is the earliest to mention 'the ghosts'.) However, the entities he calls 'the ghosts' in his extended discourse easily resist such simplistic analysis; in his philosophy of life, they stand in the first rank of importance. His manifold vituperations against the ghosts portray a formidable race of enchanters whom he blames entirely for the cataclysm that destroyed his world, the magnificent civilization of the Ancients. There does exist (or did: the original has never been located) what may have been an early 'draft' of this saying, never officially incorporated into any previous structuring of the Archives, but ever lurking, as it were, among the miscellanea of unplaceable artifacts when they were transmitted. Here is a reconstruction of that text: The yelp of impatience trumpets the Advent of the ghosts. [By all reports, strikethrough in original. &mdash; Ed.] This variant of the saying, though similar in sense, bears different freight, to wit: in the «draft version» quoted just above, the 'yelp of impatience' merely announces that the ghosts are near, or on their way, thus describing a symptom beyond the observer's control; whereas in the «received version» reproduced in this edition, the act of becoming impatient itself has agency (it blows a trumpet), which summons the ghosts into the scene, whereupon, presumably, they bring to bear their ruinous influence on whatever ensues. In either case, one must wonder: how can it be that impatience serves to reveal or, worse, musters the ghosts? Let us pause for a moment to ponder the operant term «impatience», which serves as the title of this antique Writing: it will more than repay any interruption in the flow of thought thus far. What is impatience, after all? The loss (or relinquishment) of equanimity, in reaction to an unanticipated development in the unfolding of time: one had expected (or wished) one thing was to occur, but something else happened instead. Interrogating this circumstance, we must back away enough to perceive two elements that constitute the situation, an expectation and the event, and then ask, How did this expectation or wish come about? or, to hint at an answer by rephrasing the question, What was the origin of the unsound expectation in the first place? How would the Last One reply? How else? &mdash; The ghosts, fool. What did you think?   On {enemy}: Text is our enemy: the utterance of the ghosts. This brief indictment was originally thought to be a paragraph taken from {What can we do here?}, itself a much-copied transcription that by custom was bundled with the so-called Sermons of Egderus, presumably delivered during his tenure as Superius Frater at Mountain House. A later curator extracted this specific passage from that Writing to its own document, certain that its first sentence (or two, depending on how it is parsed) represented an instance of migratory text, claiming that it was in fact a bona fide Saying of the Remnant (without specifying how that attribution was to be validated), and that the brief explicatory phrase (about immortal fame) which followed constituted a gloss that itself became separated from its original referent and was re-attached here. The thesis that motivated this act of violence upon an ancient arrangement of the Archives has ramifications that can be treacherous, but are worth outlining here, as no one else seems to have perceived the need for this essential forensic work. To begin with, the mention of the ghosts in the second clause at least implicates the Last One, whose Writings constitute an entire discourse on the entities (or, perhaps better expressed, collective symbol) he calls the ghosts: his assertion in those Writings is that their origin, medium of action, and dwelling place are all founded in &mdash; even wholly constituted by &mdash; text. Although Egderus never mentions the ghosts anywhere else in his extant writings, he is all but universally believed to have passed along the works of the Last One when he gathered, preserved, and transmitted the Archives during the Goliadic Age. This being the case, it is hard to believe that Egderus was not familiar with the Last One's theories, and may well have become 'infected' with one or another of that elder Author's crabby ideas. But this is mere background. It is when we try to analyze the transmission of this tart morsel of invective that the true dimensions of the matter begin to emerge. Let us begin with the obvious, as contemporary investigators are ever advocating. This string of text (migratory or not) was found among the Writings of Egderus, and so may well be a writing by Egderus. If so, is it complete, in its present form, that is, by itself? Perhaps, but this seems unlikely: Egderus is frequently aphoristic, but almost always attributes his pithy sayings to the Remnant, and even then only to illustrate or support one point among many in a longer essay, sermon, or memoir &mdash; that is, Egderus never seems to have composed epigrams that stand on their own. But Egderus is hardly unique in quoting the Remnant, nor in employing crisp locutions of his own invention. Let us allow, then, that this particular example is a fragment of some other Writing &mdash; whether by Egderus or not may be argued elsewhere. The question is, what motivated its extraction from the document in which it was found? [The text of this peculiar (and peculiarly long) consideration breaks off here &mdash; Ed.]","Onimpatienceandtheenemy.html"],
	["only I can do","... I have finished reading the primaryTexts in myScholar's archives, and am now plunging into his commentaries and analysis, much of which secondaryText is, at least to my mind, pretty naive. But then he is (or was) an utter provincial, as best I can determine from his own narratives of his experience with these documents. The House he describes as his origination must have been extremely remote from this (onceuponatime) mighty Temple of the Conference of Professional Scholars and their Students, a throng of rascals and reprobates that once included me. It matters little how low I've fallen in the years since I toe-danced through this Cathedral of Learning, now the Smoking Pit I'm scrabbling in: the discovery myScholar made is profound, and the pull of his conviction of its consequence strengthens in me with every word I read. Perhaps I can put his experience with us in some perspective, since of course he could not do so himself, for many reasons: his own artlessness, the depth of his obsession with these peculiar materials, their peculiarity, and, ultimately, the cravenness of our governing Council, who should have helped and supported him in the face of deeply disturbing ideas. Now that I've condemned everyone else, let me remind myself that the viewpoint of his tormentors was my viewpoint as well: even if I had comprehended what was happening (and I was only a student at the time), I would have done exactly what I did, which was nothing, except to shake my head and cluck, along with my friends, without thinking much about what he was being put through, nor the implications, for the life of our whole community, of his being treated so. I can only hope that, if my dear Scholar is no longer living amongst us, he was able to depart in peace and quietness. Now, here, I can see two worlds past this one (if the hole I'm huddling in still qualifies for world status): one is myScholar's rustic world &mdash; alien enough for a city child like me &mdash; and beyond it the world barely sketched out by the writings he gathered and brought here, where he tried to find them a home. It is rather like watching an eclipse at sunset: soon both worlds will slip out of sight. The near one is dark; the further one blazes so bright I can hardly bear to look at it. Perhaps I'll turn up a shard of smoked glass here in the rubble...   Whoever was given charge of these materials immediately after their Confiscation simply was not competent to do anything meaningful with them. My guess is that some senile Council member had a young 'friend' whose career the old degenerate wished to promote, and the poor thing was put in front of these Writings to make something of them. Be that as it may, I can see traces &mdash; in this imagined young person's encounter with the materials &mdash; of the eventual growth of a sympathetic attitude toward myScholar's desire to bring these remarkable texts to light. There is evidence that more than one curator handled these writings; it is theoretically possible that a legitimate thinker was able to examine them profitably for a time. But I lack the resources to conduct the forensic analysis that might substantiate this inference, however fascinating it would be to learn of other devotees these unusual tales have won to their care; myScholar is clearly not the first. In addition &mdash; as his presentation notes imply&mdash; myScholar discerned a larger story embracing all, but so far that comprehensive narrative eludes me. I am able to guess at parts of the whole saga, but can only make out here and there a connection between two or more authors... For myself, I have been converted to myScholar's obsession with these writings, even if I am not yet convinced of their &mdash; how shall I put this? &mdash; authenticity. That is, were I to apply the standards and protocols of my former community of scholars, which after all trained me to exactly this kind of undertaking, my most generous assessment of the writings' origins would have to be that they are of unknown provenance &mdash; and that means, among other things, that they could have been forged, by (a) perpetrator(s) also unknown. And who would be the first logical suspect in such a case...? myScholar, of course.   I started by making a list, which generated another list, and then another, until I now have enough catalogs to account for every item I think I will need in order to finish. There are writings I cannot place, or cannot understand, or are so damaged I cannot even guess what they are about, what story they have to tell, what has happened to them. But these obscure fragments have influence upon the rest, so that even when they wander from place to place in the structure, the whole feels their weight, and responds....   ... I haven't had a chance like this for a very long time: shelter, solitude, time &mdash; there's even food here! Most important, I have a mission: to transform this ragbag of wildly divergent texts into a proper archive. A single thread stitches each to every other: the same desire and longing, the same resolve I feel when I think of you, Dear myReader: someone, somewhere, even in another time, will want to know what became of us, how that came to be, how it was with us in the moment of our life. How excited I am! how young I feel! Every living being should be given this gift: the means, the motive, and the material for doing ONLY the work that ONLY I can do! HaHA!!","onlyIcando.html"],
	["on march","After the meeting, we set off in the dark. For some reason, we couldn't wait until morning, but had to get away from the place &mdash; stupid, really, certainly foolhardy &mdash; on the other hand, the decision being made, it was time to go. The old man himself couldn't have been kinder: sad, of course, that we could not (or would not) all stay together with him &mdash; for he felt sure, everyone could tell, that we will be caught out here &mdash; but also because our departure will without doubt weaken the defenses of those we are leaving behind. But he seemed to appreciate our point, that we can't just wait for the enemy to show up and burn the place down with us in it &mdash; even though he could not agree that our leaving was the right thing to do. Mostly, I think, the old man grieved that we would not turn from our purpose, that is, to retaliate, take revenge on the enemy for wrecking everything. He honestly believes that payback never succeeds, but only makes things worse, and reconciliation is the only way. I cannot see how that could work in this case, but I respect his experience, if not the conclusions he has drawn from it. That is, I am glad to have his advice about how best to foil the foe, as he puts it: he's had more than a little practice in subtle sabotage, though some of his proposals struck our leaders as too subtle, or worse: just plain old, therefore useless. That was then, they say; this is now. My friends are wrong about this: we should be willing to try anything to achieve our purpose &mdash; that is, to stop the enemy from further depredation on us and our world &mdash; and I will remember the old man's antique ideas, for I believe some might still be best. No point in arguing, however: our leaders are possibly more set in their ways than the old man is in his. But the prospect of actually doing something concrete is many days ahead. Our plan is generally good, but still needs work: until last night, our biggest challenge was persuading the old man to let us go. As it happened, that was easy: he saw at once we were resolved, that keeping us back would sour feelings among us all, and in the end could only delay the inevitable.   The old man was right: anger destroys everything. It has certainly eaten into the happiness of our band of hopeful insurgents: our leaders, who are (or were) lovers, have fallen out over what to do next, and their wrangling is getting worse: last night they actually started grappling and hitting each other. The rest of us pretended to be asleep, but the commotion they were making was impossible to ignore. I'll just say that it was not the night-noise we were accustomed to hear coming from their tent.   For days I have been thinking of going back to the old man &mdash; I've always believed in our cause, but just now we are too few, or too weak, to inflict significant harm upon our enemy. I am no longer sure I even know what that would mean: we haven't been able to get close enough to any of his installations to do productive reconnoitering, let alone set to work 'foiling' him. It feels like we're only marching about, playing soldiers in the woods. There are others who share my feelings, I know, though no one has said a thing to me. Nor will I bring it up &mdash; I'm afraid I really don't trust anyone but myself, and may just fall back on our next march and slip away. I actually feel quite homesick for the House and its gentle inhabitants, the old man most of all.   Seeing that we are too many to move about all together, our leaders (reconciled, for the moment) have divided us into three companies of a half-dozen each. I am in charge of the scouting party, and our leaders will each of them lead one or the other of the remaining groups: the company who comes after that will consolidate the position of potential camp sites my party locates, while the last group will work with sympathetic locals to secure passage through their territory &mdash; and possibly persuade them to collaborate with us. Overall, we're heading in the general direction of the City, primarily doing reconnaissance, until our leaders can agree upon a viable strategy of actual action. I prefer my part in this division of labor: we spend the night out in the open, just the six of us. Since we left the old man's mountain refuge weeks ago, we've stayed fairly high up, skirting larger communities where the enemy is likely to be entrenched. This suits me well: I have little gift for talking my way into a situation with strange people. Happily, whenever we must enter a village or town, one of our company is very good at this kind of first contact, a woman slightly older than I who has an innocent face and friendly manner. Taking the lead, she poses as 'eldest sister', apologizing for the crude behavior of the rest of us, whom she has taught to remain silent and act cowed by her affectionate tyranny. At the same time she convincingly explains our expedition as a search for a safe place to live, since our home district was destroyed in the fighting. In the course of this masquerade, we gain much good information about the surrounding area and the people in it. This we pass along to the groups that follow us. Her performance is so winning that we have yet to experience the least difficulty with any locals we have encountered. But I worry that her sometimes overcheerful manner might make us too memorable...   Tonight the River of Stars is very bright. Gazing at it fills me with such longing the tears come, and I must wrap my arms tight around me to keep from sobbing aloud. I cannot explain it. I have been told that every grain in that broad swath of stardust is another world like this one, with uncountable beings living there, each reaching for better things and fleeing danger, loving their own and fearing others. Many think that this is the only way to be, to live &mdash; that is, to struggle &mdash; at least in this world. But I hope not. Somewhere, I must believe, somehow, all beings can live in peace, everyone, always and everywhere, our whole lives long, this priceless gift of life, and learning to understand it, passing down through us, one generation to another... It has been said that good cannot exist without evil, joy without suffering. I will not go along with this: saying that is lazy, just giving in to what we fear instead of acting on what we hope, what we love, what we want for everyone to have &mdash; it does nothing to prevent crime, excuses it before the fact, even encourages gangsters to wonder what they can get away with. Some, like the old man, say forgiveness is the only cure, and I agree that, if the criminal repents, he must be forgiven &mdash; or else the cycle of vengeance goes on and on, getting worse with each blow in recompense. But I am not sure forgiveness is a solution, or a complete one. I do not know what that would be, but on nights such as this I feel &mdash; no: I believe &mdash; that the answer can be found, because it must be...   We now have a perfect hideaway for the twenty of us, all snuggled up in a little cave in the mountains; its entrance is hidden, it commands a clear view of every approach, and a network of tunnels lead to exits elsewhere, through which we can scatter and escape. For the past few days we have been stocking the place with supplies and weapons, getting ready to fully mount our mission. Now that I turn my mind to it, I find that I care rather less about that mission than I did when we first left the House. Then we were fired by outrage and impatience, eager to hit the enemy, hurt him, pay him back for his atrocities against us and those we love. But as the weeks drew along, and the practicalities of living in the open imposed themselves upon us, I found that I enjoyed engaging such pragmatic matters, and I forgot for long periods that there even was an enemy to be struggled against, a foe to foil. I only dislike our wandering life when it involves tricking strangers into helping us, but then 'eldest sister' takes charge, which is always a relief for me &mdash; not to mention entertaining: I admire her spirit and ingenuity, and especially her good humor, which she imposes on everyone, our leaders included. And she certainly never spares me &mdash; her teasing can make me blush like a schoolboy... [Fragment ends here. &mdash; Ed.]","onmarch.html"],
	["On the Arrangement of the Writings","In the course of transmitting this Archive of archives, its Curators have found it useful to divide the over three hundred Writings it comprises into three textTypes: primary texts, the personal narratives forming the fundamental materials of the Archives; secondary texts, commentaries that annotate and elucidate the primary texts; and tertiary texts, which a framework for the whole: lists, outlines, maps(!) and other affordances for finding a way in, through, and around the Writings Primary Writings have been arranged throughout in descending order by Author, within a an overarching structure of historical eras called timeBands: the most recent timeBand is designated as being of Unknown Provenance, since nothing is known of the transmission of the Archives since the Age of the Scholar, a figure associated with the community of the Temple of Learning during its flourishing, and who rediscovered the Archives at some point after the Age of Egderus, their first Curator, who, in addition to providing a vivid portrait of his own life and times, first gathered in one place the Writings of The Ancients, denizens of a magnificent civilization that they themselves destroyed. This arrangement somewhat resembles the cross-section of an archaeological excavation &mdash; more recent items appear near the top, older ones lie towards the bottom. (Within each Author's listing, however, the titles appear in their (deduced) order of composition. Consult scholion {in descending order} for a discussion of this controversial gambit.) Secondary Writings are of two kinds, Legomona andScholia. Each Legomenon elucidates all the Writings of a given Author or group; each Scholion annotates a particula4 passage within a specific Writing. The long catalogs that list the Legomena and the Scholia are, as with the primaryTexts, ranked in descending order of their referents. Tertiary Writings appear as needed throughout the Archives &mdash; for example, in the catalogs known as bookPlates (such as the bookPlate Egderus) as ancillary Writings such as the Preface, the Foreword, and the Afterword, act as general guides to help the reader understand how the Writings are related to one another and to get around among them.","OntheArrangementoftheWritings.html"],

The earliest extant renderings of the Writing, however, make it one word, 'ourWorld', which a sleepy copyist or dull-witted editor might easily regard as an error in transcription &mdash; or, to be fair, a mere eccentricity on the Author's part, insignificant in itself. Certainly it would be foolish to wax pedantic about so small a matter &mdash; if the Author in question were not the Last One, whose eccentricities are never insignificant, and his peculiar orthography might bear meaning here that it were truly foolish to pass over in such a patronizing manner. Whatever the case, the older form has been respected here, restoring what is felt to be its technical sense in the Author's body of thought: a World of OUR making, as opposed to other Worlds that may exist &mdash; created, it may be, by Others we would do well not to disregard...","ourWorld.html"],

My friends, my family, all my loved ones, all rest content in this moment (as content as any of us ever is), if it can be said that they share this moment with me &mdash; well, of course it can be said: anything can be said. My question is &mdash; what I'm wondering is &mdash; what is that relation between us, now, in this moment, the last moment of my life? In other words, is there a relation, here, now, between me and my dearest ones? None that I can reach. To talk about 'them' at all is just to talk. 'They' exist only in me, at least now, in this moment &mdash; for me, this last moment... Were I suddenly to change my mind (and of course I reserve that right), and destroy all these farewell messages I have just composed for them to find here, then, after I am gone; should I decide not to go, and instead run to them, into their arms, vowing never to leave them or even to think about it, ever again &mdash; I would be no closer to them than I am now, alone, in the middle of the night, when they are all asleep, as I imagine them, while I keep this last watch, reflecting on the &mdash; well, my &mdash; end. I blow out the candle and lean back, gazing at the moon, watch the last wisp of black smoke rise past it into nothingness. The moon is just past full, still high but slipping, down toward the mountain waiting to swallow it, while behind it the dawn sky is just beginning to whiten, and my neighbors' habitations creep out of the dark. My heart is calm; my eyes are open; I am not afraid. Never again will I be forced into the customary near-panic that comes with contending &mdash; no, with having to contend &mdash; against whatever it is where no one is safe, nothing stays the way it was, everything changes, ever, nowhere to hide from it, no way to get away from it, no place even to stand, everything slipping, like the moon toward the mountain, while, in the town, the bells ring, the birds sing, the dogs wake everybody who isn't already rushing from here to there to fix this or that or to try to catch whatever got away the moment before. It's called real life but it isn't real, it's phantoms chasing phantoms all the livelong day &mdash; and then in the night, the dreams that come are as real as any workaday disaster after the sun comes up. I love the night, with its fantastic reveries &mdash; the moment I turn over and realize I was only dreaming I am so relieved I say, I will dream on! because going back to sleep is waking from the nightmare of the day, you cannot convince me otherwise, you fool, you're dreaming just like everyone else, and in the end will just be dreaming that, just like every thing else. Please don't try to tell me it is not like this, that it is something else entirely: it is just like this, like very this, every moment &mdash; this is where we live, or try to, only to fail in the end &mdash; &mdash; but if we're lucky we can hand something off to someone who may come across it later and take it on and make it something else, then pass that on to someone else. I love to imagine that friend, for that is who it will be, when I am gone, who will take what's left of me and give it along with what's left of then to the next one. That's what's real, the only thing: take it, whatever it is, and pass it on. Time to go.","passiton.html"],

Atop the taller side, a small pyramid of sharper stones rises, a monument stacked to a knee-high point in memory of some lost sage or suicide, and I stop and paddle back, then spy a path-head just beside the pile, which itself bears no inscription. I tie the boat to keep it company, and climb into the forest, then up and up, winding back and forth across an ever steeper slope. Even the pines give out before the trail does, and soon I find a tunnel into the rocky shoulder the mountain turns to me, impassable any other way. Inside, the grotto roof is bloody red, but no story arises to explain, and so, when the cave opens out at its other end, I climb on, and push and drag my ancient bones with feet and hands along the path and then, at last, with elbows and knees. On a broad plateau, a rocky meadow sprouting tufty weeds like an old man's beard welcomes me to rest, and I lie on my back, and gasp and laugh at my aged body that still believes it is young, poor fool. A fool but a happy one, it corrects me, and I'm happily reproved. Up here, the sky surrounds all, rinsing rocks and weeds and one old man with brilliant light and a cool spring breeze, then drying us all with bright whitest cloud.","patteran.html"],
	["Peripatikos Soter","... And of course we came here as soon as we could, once it seemed to be safe... It was a superb afternoon, just like that terrible day itself: brilliant sun, deep blue sky, not one cloud. When we arrived, the air was glistening with dust, pinkish gray, which caused the sun to look rather lovely to him, he said, no doubt thinking to cheer me. But I knew what that dust was made of, what it had to be made of, to be that color &mdash; and to smell like that. Just inside the collapsed gateway, someone behind us sniffed sharply, as if drinking in the stench of melted glass and metal, charred wood, days-old roasted flesh. Everyone turned: a short stocky gentleman, in ordinary dress, stood like a stone amidst the stream of sightseers flowing around him, his lips curled back, eyes incandescent, his gaze fixed fiercely on something we could not see. I knew that look &mdash; and there was no mistaking the bulge at the place where the man's legs joined. I said nothing to my friend, but quickly took his hand and led him away. How could I explain how I knew about such things? We neared what should have been the Locust Grove, but it was impossible to find: all the lovely tall trees in the entire Precinct were nothing but sticks jutting up like twisted-off arms and legs. My friend was so appalled I knew I had to get him away, before his gentle heart was overwhelmed with the question no one can ever answer. At the time it was still unclear what had actually happened, and to this day no irrefutable proof has been put forward to vindicate any of several competing hypotheses. On that glorious sunny afternoon, it was still possible for my friend to blame tragic accident for such awful devastation, and I said nothing to discourage him from clinging to this hopeful theory. In the event, [Breaks off &mdash; Ed.] =====[lacuna]=====   The obvious choice was suicide, but somehow the demon that entered me at the Retreat House wasn't finished with me yet... =====[lacuna?]=====   I cannot tell how I returned hither...   ... no account of my travels can do justice...   ... but it would mean nothing: no place offered any rest, no person's regard was worth the effort to win, no work worth performing. I merely removed from one place to another, without hope, without light, my heart a dead cinder in my breast. [possible lacuna...]   My only companion on this desolate voyage was the memory of that drunken scholar who vomited up his whole life into the crystalline waters of the cove in the Temple gardens, and then pinned me with his eyes, daring me to laugh at what he suffered. This Raggedy Man haunted me for a reason I could never quite grasp. But I was grateful to him (or rather to his ghost) whenever he reappeared in my thoughts, for I somehow felt that my meeting with him was the moment of my life, strange as that may seem: there was no question that after our one meeting in the Locust Grove, nothing I created or performed in that sheltered world seemed quite sufficient to justify &mdash; or excuse the suffocating drudgery and servility required for its attainment; the pride in the faces of my more productive colleagues never quite reached me, no matter what I achieved; or if it did, I at once perceived, behind it, gazing at me over the shoulder of the glittering prize, the image of that shabby scholar, his eyes burning with their unspoken demand. [possible lacuna...]   And so it came about that by inches and by hours, as the Remnant say, I made my way back to this point of origin, the scene of the crime, though it took quite a while for me to recognize what had once been the Locust Grove, because the place itself was uninhabited, all but covered by ramshackle dwellings of the most disconsolate sort &mdash; indeed, I was drawn there initially by the promise of shelter that, from a distance, they seemed to offer, for by then I shared their insalubrious condition. Unaccountably, these hovels were abandoned, as if unsuitable for even the most wretched of beings, and during my time there not one other person appeared to keep me company &mdash; or to drive me away. I judged the place to be under a kind of curse, to which I was perhaps immune, being the bearer of an even worse malediction myself. Once I recognized where I was, however, I immediately sought out the Temple ruins, but found only a smoking crater where they should have been. The fire down in there would have smouldered many years, for I was still in the City when the Temple was destroyed. The crater was deep, littered with rubble and debris half-submerged in evil-looking muck. Working my way around its perimeter as best I could manage, I suddenly perceived, some levels down in the opposite wall of the hollow, the sheared-off corridor that had once led to the Conference Archives. Immediately all strength went out of my legs, and I nearly pitched headlong into the hole. For I had once labored there, as we all did, in our first years as students in the Temple School. The sun was just setting behind me, as I sat down hard on the edge of the caldera that had once been, when I had one, my home. =====[lacuna]=====   And there, beneath a charred heap of all manner of administrivial documents, I found myScholar's archive. It had taken until midday to work my way down the nearly sheer wall of the crater, and the rest of the afternoon to enlarge the opening into the warren of rooms where the Temple records were kept. An utterly dismal place: dark, dank, smutched with countless generations of torch smoke, where the least among the Conference drudges were consigned as if to perdition &mdash; quite the opposite of the bright airy library adjoining the Council's chambers, atop the Temple tower, with its wondrous vista of the entire harbor. And yet I loved this gloomy dungeon. Our time here as starveling apprentices was awful, for the Recorders were bitter men, and my master was the bitterest. He was kept here, he told me, on account of his clean hand and prodigious memory: and his catalogs were indeed works of art, both as exemplars of clarity and as finding aids. He was also a notorious pederast &mdash; though, to me at least, a surprisingly gentle one, if one could believe the stories my fellows told about their masters' private comportment. While he and I were at work with the others in the archives he was very quick to cuff and even beat me if I failed him in the slightest way, but when we were alone he could be quite solicitous, and it was he who taught me how to enjoy myself even as I serviced him. No, I loved this place because of its secrets, which interested none of my comrades, so anxious were they all, during this sojourn in hell, to get it done with, so that they could ascend into the light of their future greatness, as they imagined was their destiny. This is, of course, the way I think of it now, from the distance of hard years. It is difficult to retrieve my view of things then, but perhaps that's a mercy. No doubt I was preoccupied, just as they all were, with emulating those most admired among our friends. It is the way of the young; and is it not this very lack of self-sufficiency &mdash; this 'weakness' &mdash; that our elders exploit, too feeble or cynical to fight their own battles, sending us out to perform their evil and deadly work, knowing fully and well (as we cannot imagine) the frightful consequences? Is this not the vengeance the old cannot visit on their elders, who did the same to them when they were young like us?   I have set up a work area down here where I can examine and organize myScholar's material. It is mere luck that the building collapsed in just the way it did, exposing the very pile of documents in which his records have been languishing all these years. Truly, neglect has a way of preserving things, as the Remnant say. For good or ill, I must add. I am aware, now that I have examined the archives, that their transmission may prove to be more trouble than they are worth. But, perhaps, given my spiteful frame of mind, that *is* their worth. The collection has suffered little damage since being abandoned, being so deeply buried among the bureaucratic detritus of the Council's deliberations and findings. I cannot be certain, of course, that these records pertain to my Raggedy Man, but I like to believe they do, and that I can in some way redress the wrong done to him so long ago. I have no doubt that all the principal players have since passed on, or in any case have long ago relinquished any memory of this matter. But then perhaps that is my worth: I only am escaped alone to tell thee this tale.","PeripatikosSoter.html"],
	["place","It is the time of a major festa here in my adopted town: last night the street from which my little lane branches was closed off by bonfires built at each intersection, which allowed people on foot to come in but kept all other traffic out. Between the two fires, next to a doorway, a small shelter was built against the wall by propping posts in the gutter, tying beams onto and between them with fibers of straw, then leaning sheaves of dry stalks on the frame to make sides and a roof. This simple structure was then decorated with leaves and strings of seedpods, and inside stood three costumed children, about ten years of age, two girls and a shorter boy whose little round face was adorned by a beard drawn on with fire-smudge &mdash; perhaps he was playing a husband or father. My neighbors gathered round them, chanting, and every moment more people came and joined in. This I watched from my roof, squatting by the stubby chimney, which stands guard over the tiny crossing where all this unfolded. The chanting went on for a time, then abruptly its tune changed, and the children came out of the shelter, singing a simple melody. The crowd gave a response to each line, following as the children turned down the street, then stopped at the first open doorway. There they sang a different two-line phrase, and two or three voices responded from inside, then the incantation went back and forth three times between the two groups. Finally the children turned away, returning to the first melody, and the whole procession moved along to the next 'station', where this ritual was repeated. When the children reached the fire at the far crossing, they led the assembly in a ragged wheeling maneuver, and came back in the same manner, stopping at each dwelling along the other side of the street, arriving at last at the doorway beside the shelter where the procession began. At this the people inside, whom I could see from my perch, brought food and drink out into the intersection. The children tore off the costumes they wore over their everyday clothes and ran into the crowd, tussling and giggling with their friends, and an impromptu musical consort burst into an energetic dance tune, which set everyone laughing and shouting. I was charmed, as you can imagine, but also unprepared for the upwelling of homesickness that immediately followed. I was unable to hold back insistent tears, and barely managed to stifle a yowl of grief before turning away and clambering down to my room. Here I have been imprisoned for nearly two days by the tireless revelry that continues in the street below, blocking my way out and depriving me of sleep. I can now sing (indeed, cannot stop singing) what I imagine to be every ditty, march, drinking song, and love-lament these people seem to know, and of which they never weary. The musicians among them have improved noticeably from all this repetition, and I would not be surprised to discover that more than one of their number has used this celebration to learn to play well an instrument never even tried before.","place.html"],

I am not sure why the Golias wanted it done, but I am certain that the reason he wanted me to do it was to keep it secret. Perhaps you know why; I can only tell you that I made it quick, if not painless. The moment he saw me, he knew why I was there.

	["purple berries","I found the two of them not far out on the moor, apart from the others, right when lieutenant ordered the grove set on fire. Made me sick &mdash; these poor souls had done nothing, they knew nothing, they put up no resistance when we fell on them, and none of them understood an [expletive] word any of us said to them, so interrogating them was useless. I believe that's what pushed lieutenant over the edge, made him say just get rid of them all; it made some sense, I guess, because what were we going to do, drag and drive all twenty of them two days and more back through all that quag and broken land to their scrawny little hometown, just so some translator could tell us they had no idea what we were demanding of them? Or where the 'terrorist' that was supposed to be with them had gone? Only he wasn't with them &mdash; we knew what he looked like, which was nothing like any of them. Bastard probably lit out from a whole nother side of town and was halfway to the moon by now. But there those two were, hiding in a gully no more than fifty paces out on the moor, an old woman and a girl nine or ten; the little one had diarrhea, and the old one was trying to help her, however she thought that was supposed to work. At least the girl wasn't vomiting, or the noise would've brought somebody else, one of the nasty proper [expletives] who like chopping people up, not an ordinary human fool like me. Didn't know why in that moment, but instead of ratting them out I made a big show of scanning the horizon and checking every bush, at the same time signaling the old one to stay put and make no sound. By the time I got back to the grove, the rest of her group had been butchered and the whole [expletive] place was going up, and I had to make a long run around it to catch up with the platoon, which was moving out double-time &mdash; no doubt the idea was to get as far from here as we could before nightfall. Something slipped out of my pack as I jogged over the clumps, but I couldn't see what it was, and after a quick look I just kept going. But as I ran, a voice inside kept telling me to [expletive] the platoon, [expletive] the lieutenant, let them all go, let them get away from me, let me get away from them &mdash; I hated lieutenant, I hated both sergeants, but most I hated the rest of the stupid jerks who just did whatever they were told, no matter how gruesome or perverted. No; no: the very worst of all I hated myself for going along with the rest of them, the sick sadistic [expletives]. I kept falling further back, until somebody must have noticed I wasn't with them, and they stopped. So I stopped too, breathing heavy and holding my side like I had a stitch. I waved at them to go on, but [expletive] lieutenant sent some poor juvenile [expletive] back towards me. By that time I had my pack off and was rummaging in it, and found out my mess kit was what fell out. But I also snuck my weapon off and hid it under the pack before the kid was close enough to see me do it, and I yelled at him to go ahead without me, I'd catch up. He just stood there like the dumb [expletive] he was, like he couldn't comprehend what I was saying, so I told him I'd lost my weapon and had to go back and look for it. I was raised in woods like this, I told him, I'll be able to track you, tell sergeant I'll be fine and see you all tomorrow if it gets too dark today. He jogs back to the sergeant, who blows up in his face, and then starts towards me himself, still yelling, but I pretend I don't understand him and keep motioning they should go on without me. In a moment, lieutenant calls the sergeant back, and they jaw for a bit, while I keep looking around on the ground as if searching real hard. Then the poor grunt's headed back towards me again and the platoon's moving out the other way, so I run up to the poor sod, curse him good, make him understand I'm not gonna have a silly punk [expletive] like him trying to 'help me' and getting us both killed or at least hurt, and in the end I just threatened to pound the [expletive] out of him if he didn't get the [expletive] away from me and let me go find my weapon before it was the middle of the night. He looked like he might argue, but I could see he was scared of losing the group, so I told him not to worry, blame it on me, he didn't have to get [expletived] just because I couldn't keep track of my [expletive] weapon. He said he'd murder me if he got in trouble for this, but he was already turning away and I said as kindly as I could that that sounded good to me. As soon as all of them were out of sight I put my pack back on, grabbed up my weapon from where I'd hid it, and headed back to the fire. It was really getting dark, but I'd be [expletived] if I wasn't going to find that old woman and the little girl. I stopped for a good long time to hear if anyone was following, but it looked like I was going to get away with this, so I hiked around the fire again and went back to the gully, and there they still were, the little girl all twisted up in agony. She'd die from it if I didn't help, and then the other one would catch it and she'd die too. But I had some medicine in my pack, even if I'd lost my rations. When I came up on them, the old one had a good-looking stick ready for me, and I'm not sure I would have prevailed if she came at me with it. But I put down my weapon and took off my pack and held both hands up, and then I tried some sign language to tell her I had medicine, which she seemed to understand, so I got it out of my pack and and gave her a bit, some for the girl and some for her, and signaled she should take it with water from my flask. She signed back I should take some first, which I realized was a good idea, so I did, and then she gave the same amount to the girl and took the rest herself. The girl was an awful mess, so I pulled my other undershirt out of my pack and between us we got her mostly cleaned up with it. Then I took it back to the fire and threw the filthy [expletive] in. While the medicine took effect, the old one sort of hunkered there petting the girl, and I stayed at the top of the bank to make sure no one was coming back after me. The fire was getting really hot now, and some of the heath was starting to catch, so we'd have to move out right smart or get cooked in the gully. But then I noticed tracks leading out onto the moor and went over to see where they went. I couldn't really tell how old they were, but they didn't look quite fresh, though they could have been today's, and they were headed towards the mountains, which were too dark to see now but I remembered looking at them across the moor when we first got to the grove. I was in truth brought up near woods and waste like this, and I do know how to stay alive out here, but I never let lieutenant nor anyone else know that, because then I'd've gotten to be useful to them, and that just makes trouble for a person. Besides, what the [expletive] did I care what any one of those [expletive] [expletives] thought of me? In a moment the old one came up out of the gully with the girl in her arms, staggering a little, so I strapped on my weapon and took the girl fom her, while the old one went and got my pack and came back with it on her shoulders, and we started off. I tried to follow the tracks, but once we got away from the fire it was just too dark, so I set a course best I could by dead reckoning, hoping the tracks didn't change direction too much once they got out on the moor. After about an hour I could tell the old one was fit to drop, so I halted us and scouted around in the heath until I found a fair spot with an overhang under a crag that was sheltered from the wind, and also invisible from the direction of the fire. I got the two of them settled, then climbed up the side of the crag so I could see what was what back the way we came. It was a breezy night with no moon, but the clear sky was magnificent. The River of Stars, as a kind of sick joke, came right up out of the fire on the horizon, which by now was blazing high. I watched it for a long time, for I was sure that if anyone came in our direction, I'd be able to see their silhouette against the flames. After a good long look, I went back down and found them both asleep, the old one sitting with her back against the crag, the little one curled against her with her arms folded up, the old one's arms around her. I unrolled my blanket and spread it over them; the old one opened her eyes and I signed that I would be up above. She nodded, but almost as soon as her eyes went shut her mouth fell open and she started to snore. On top of the crag again, I finally took a deep breath and began to face up to what I'd just done. I don't need to go into what they'd do to me if, unlikely as it seemed at the moment, lieutenant changed his mind and sent a detail back to find out what happened to me. He was a creep and mean, sure enough, but he wasn't a smart soldier, so I judged he wouldn't really get worried about me till morning and I hadn't showed up, and then he'd likely figure I wasn't worth the trouble, which would be true. But even if he thought it all the way through, and realized it would be better all around if he made sure I wouldn't make any trouble for him, we still were probably safe for a day or so, and by that time I hoped to have things fixed so nobody'd find us, ever. I'd been with that debased [expletive] long enough to observe how he did things: what was most important to him was looking good, or at least not be reckoned responsible if something went wrong, and this whole mission was tailor-made to [expletive] his career in a maximum kind of way. If he went to the captain and reported what had actually happened, and on top of that we didn't capture the [expletive] 'terrorist' the captain had sent us after, not only would lieutenant be busted down to no rank at all, he'd be sweating out the rest of his tour in a cell with two cots and three amorous giants. I didn't know how he'd do it, but I did know that by the time he got back to base in the town, lieutenant would have a terrific story: not only would he take credit for catching the bugger everybody was looking for, but he also would have faked up some kind of evidence that the bugger was dead and in a way he richly deserved and nobody'd have to worry about him ever again. The two sergeants would of course back up this tall tale, because they were just as evil and lazy as he was, only not so smart. And they'd all get promotions, maybe medals, plus the thanks of a grateful nation. I just wished there was something more I could do to help make sure that that was exactly how it worked out, because then we'd all be safe, bugger included, and by this time all I wanted in this life was to get out of range of people like lieutenant and his goons and the so-called people they answered to. If I could bring a couple souls away with me, so much the better. And that's why I just about had a stroke when I saw a silhouette come between me and that fire. I watched for the longest time, not even breathing, until I realized the silhouette was getting shorter, not taller, as it would have done if whoever it was was coming our way. And there was only one of them, which wasn't like lieutenant at all &mdash; he'd have sent at least four. Of course, they could be spread out, and only one of them between the fire and me. But there was no mistaking it: there was a man, walking back and forth in front of that burning stand of trees, but generally moving in its direction, not towards us. Then I realized who it had to be: the bugger everybody was looking for.   So I decided we should wait, see what that shadow did. My native lack of optimism told me not to trust this hopeful interpretation &mdash; that it was the bugger and not one of lieutenant's enforcers out there &mdash; it just felt too much like good luck, and everybody knows how stupid it is to believe anything good'll come out of anything, until after it already has and you got two witnesses to certify it. And even then they could be wrong or lying. After a while, the shadow got too small to pick out from the flicker&mdash; for all I could tell, the crazy bugger had walked right into the [expletive] fire. I decided to stop wondering what he was doing, since I wasn't ever going back to that place to find out, but I'd keep as close a watch as I could, and if he returned this way, on the morrow maybe, we'd keep well hid until he was past, then follow him, in case he knew some place to go.   My daddy and my uncle were soldiers too, and they told me that when you're on a watch like I was, and you know it could go on a good while, it's best not to start thinking about things, because you get absorbed in that, and next thing you know you've gone to sleep or the thing you started out watching for is right on top of you and you're just about to be dead or wishing you were. So they taught me that what you do is you make up a little song, as you're watching, about what you're looking at, every moment &mdash; don't work at it, only tell it: what you see, what you hear, what you smell and touch and feel &mdash; and only that. Not what any of it means, nor what you hope will happen, nor what you're afraid will happen, just what IS happening, moment by moment, only what's THERE. You don't need to sing it out loud, but you do need to move your mouth around the words, and it needs to be a song, not a saying, because it's the song part that keeps you from drifting off into some [expletive] dream about how things might be or ought to be or could be if only but aren't just yet. So I worked on my little ongoing ditty and the wind died down and seven kinds of bugs came out to sing backup for me and the fire leveled out on top and then the moon rose out of it, smoky gold at first and huge but then whitening until it cleared the flames and sailed up the sky, the top left side of its face sort of flattened a little as if from a blow. And now the black moor resolved into shapes where the ground rose and fell, like the bottom of a lake when the water's drained out, and the wind came up again as the moon climbed higher, and stirred the lakebed of light as if stroking its fur, and the River of Stars retired for the night now its relief had showed up, and the bugs' song changed in response to a more silvery key. And my heart began to stir and I knew I'd done the right thing; but it was them that saved me, those two girls clinging to each other down below, and I could never leave them now. Just then a nightbird shrieked off to my left as if to poke me back awake, and I pulled it into my song, and thanked it for keeping me on my mission, which was to make sure that neither that crazy bugger out there nor no one else brought any more harm to my new friends. Nor to me, of course.   It started to rain just before dawn, and once it was light the old one climbed up, bringing my blanket, for which I was grateful, then she went back down. Somehow from the gibberish she spoke to me I understood that the girl was better and they were safe from the wet, and she seemed to understand from the gibberish I said back to her that I needed to stay here a bit longer but wasn't going to run off and leave them alone in the wilderness. She also brought me a handful of purple berries that she said were real tasty and filled you up and they were and they did. The rain put the fire out way over there and then nothing happened for a long time, and I judge I must have fallen asleep for a while, but then I saw someone moving around that smoking campsite and again my heart started thundering because this would be just about the time lieutenant's thugs might show up if they really were coming back for me. But I only saw the one person, moving here and there around the perimeter of what had burned, disappearing into what was left of the woods now and then, but coming out again a little distance away, like he was inspecting a battlefield, though you could hardly call what happened there a battle &mdash; those poor folks put up no fight at all, it was just a massacre. The old one came up again, and I knew it was time for a pow-wow. I was pretty sure that person out there wouldn't try to travel in the rain, and I'd got to thinking I could stand to dry out a little myself, so I went back down with her and found the girl awake but looking real washed out, and since we weren't going anywhere either just at the moment, I built a fire in our little shelter &mdash; I was sure the smoke wouldn't show in all this rain &mdash; and we all sat around it and got our fronts at least warm. The old one and I went back and forth speaking our customary nonsense, and the girl clung to her and stared at me but after a while she fell back asleep and pretty soon I was dozing myself. Not much happened after that. The rain stopped and I went back up to my 'watchtower', but nothing was moving in any direction, so I came back down and told the old one and the girl I was going to try to find us a bit to eat. The old one pointed towards something on the heath &mdash; as best I could tell there was a particular bush out there she wanted me to look at. When I got to it, I saw what she meant: it was a butcherbird's larder, with a field mouse and a little toad stuck on thorns about chest high. I plucked them off, exciting their owner, who screamed at me something awful, and took them back under the crag, where the old one stabbed them onto the end of a forked stick and held them over the fire. Then she shooed me out to go find some more, just like she was my mother, which I kind of liked, and it made me smile, and her too. I picked more of those purple berries and then a grasshopper jumped right into my hand, which made the old one laugh out loud when I showed her how I caught it. My reward was that I got to eat it for breakfast, while she fed the bird to the girl and took the toad herself, peeling off the skin with my knife first, of course. Not much of a feast, but it was meat, and the berries made a very fine second course. Then the girl wanted me to do the grasshopper story again, so I did, and then we all had a good laugh. I haven't laughed like that since they took me in the army, and that was years ago. Well, I'm not in the army any more, whatever else happens.   I got to thinking again about that person back at the campsite, and went up the crag to have another look. I watched for a long time and thought I saw something move there once or twice, but couldn't be sure. Question now was what to do, stay or go? I had a feeling, if that really was the man the captain wanted us to find, he might prove an ally, and we'd all have a better chance of surviving, with him and me together able to hunt. Then again, he just might be the terrorist everybody thought he was and would kill us all in our sleep, girls too, girls especially. Speaking of the girls, did he know them? Was he running with them, like the captain was sure he was? If so, where the [expletive] was he when we came screaming out of the woods and started slaughtering his friends left and right? Out on the moor relieving himself? or running away, until he saw the fire? What was this guy's story? Then I saw him for sure, bending over and straightening up out away from the burning, looked like he was retching onto the ground. Well, if it was the [expletive] I'm thinking he was, and he had been running with those people, I could see why he was spewing his insides out now. Not much of a terrorist, though, if so. Of course I knew none of the stuff I was coming up with now. Only way to find out the case was to get the old one up here for a look, if the [expletive] would still be out there by the time I fetched her back. If she could see that far. But I had to try, because if she recognized him, her reaction would tell me what to do next. We did have to get out of here; question was, with him or without him?   No resolution: I brought her back up, then couldn't get her to understand what I wanted her to see, and the guy had disappeared again, so after a time we just gave up. Can't wait around here any longer. I just can't believe my luck, not getting caught so far. I know that isn't how luck works &mdash; the way luck works is any [expletive] way it feels like, and maybe we could just sit here the rest of our lives eating bugs and toads and no one would bother us ever again. But I've been thinking that even if the story lieutenant trumped up was convincing enough to make the Ancients weep, captain won't settle for No Corpse. So sooner or later Someone will be Back. And we need to be Not Here when That Happens. If that [expletive] terrorist has any sense he'll figure that out for himself. Good: maybe we'll run into him out there...","purpleberries.html"],

	["recovery","... The next morning, I was found lying in a snowbank a good distance from the house, with tears and the other residue of long weeping frozen to my face &mdash; so close to death, I have been told, I was not even shivering. After I was brought back, I have since learned, I lay a long time in the infirmary, alternating between fiery delirium and moveless stupor, which spared me a great deal of pain. I have lost the end of my nose, the tops of both ears, and the outer digits of my feet and hands. If I ever walk again, it will be with the greatest difficulty, and I am having to learn to feed myself (and to write!) from the other side. Yesterday, a person claiming to be an old friend was led into my room near the infirmary wing. He was unbearably familiar with me, and I was only able to get rid of him by being rude. I was still fuming about this insufferable intrusion when my personal care attendant 'reminded' me that I surely must recognize the man who had sat with me so often for so long during my convalescence. I remember no such person. My attendant suggested, in his patronizing way, that the severity of my 'accident', as he called it, may have interfered with my memory. I dismissed the idea at once, but I am beginning to think that I need to take an inventory of what I do recall. Unbelievably, it has never before this moment struck me that I have no idea how I came to be lying in a snowbank a long way from the house, frozen nearly to death!   Today my attendant quit &mdash; my fault, really: we argued about my visitor again, and again he tried to persuade me that the man had come to see me with some frequency, had even written to him about me when he couldn't come himself. My attendant showed me the messages, which for all I know he wrote himself, and said so, at which point he flung the things down on my bed and told me he could no longer abide my abuse, when he was only trying to help me. I read the short writings over, once he was gone and I had somewhat recovered my composure. They are innocent enough: how is my friend, the writer asks, can I bring him anything, that sort of matter. Now that the impertinent youth is no longer here, I cannot think why he is perpetrating this hoax upon me. But I went too far. I cannot function without his or someone's help, and although it is natural for a person in my condition to be frustrated by it, my rage is ungovernable: I want to kill him, as I think I may have told him just before he stormed out of the room. I don't know what I shall do without him. Starve, I suppose, wasting away here in my own filth. Of course that will not happen. Even if the boy does not return, surely Abbas will learn of this and come to inquire. He has not visited in a long time, I realize, and I begin to wonder why. I know that there was some disturbance in the wider world troubling him; perhaps he is caught up in it somehow and cannot get away. I sense that I may have something to do with this disturbance &mdash; at the moment I cannot imagine what, but the feeling is quite strong. What could it be? What in the world happened?   Abbas did come to see me. To my shame, I lost my temper with him as well, but he is immune to offence, and only waited until my tantrum wore itself out and I was recovered enough to actually hear what he was saying to me. Of course he will procure me a better attendant, he said, but I should have had some forbearance: no one in the world will ever be able to feel or understand what I am suffering; but it is the same with every one of us, and we must be patient and kind with each other, or the community will fall apart. And I of all people must realize how catastrophic that would be. I was silent after that. The wider world is undergoing a kind of upheaval at the moment, he says, and he must use all his resources to shield us from it. He would not expatiate upon that, saying only that if we are steadfast all will be well. Foggy as my faculties are as yet, I could discern that he did not entirely believe this outcome was assured. He then addressed the matter of my visitor, whom it seems he knows well. That I do not remember him is troubling, he said, but then expressed the calm hope that my memory will return. This person is a kind of independent scholar, Abbas told me, who in fact has been very helpful in keeping him informed of developments elsewhere in the world, and this aids in keeping us safe, at least for the moment. Then he said that if he comes again, I should treat him with the utmost courtesy and respect. It was not a request. Before he left, I asked him what had happened to me. He smiled a little, and I realized I had already been told, perhaps more than once; as he remained silent, I gradually saw that he wanted me to remember it for myself. I owe this man my entire life, and hereafter I will dedicate everything I do and am to serving him. And remembering.","recovery.html"],
	["refugee","Friends have asked me to take care of their little old dog while they travel to the capital, there to try to persuade our so-called leaders to actually do something about what's going on around here. I'd been absorbed in my writing for months, too obsessed to pay much heed to the world outside, until yesterday, when my oldest friend suddenly appeared and dug me out of the hole I'd been living in. Somehow he and his mate have managed to retain their sanity (as well as their wealth) in the midst of the chaos everywhere, not just here. I'm not sure why he chose me, or how he even found me, to ask this seemingly absurd favor &mdash; I was surprised to see him at all, after so many years. And he was in a kind of flurry: once I agreed to do what he asked, he left quickly, calling over his shoulder that I should bring whatever I'd need for a short stay and come as soon as I could. I look like nothing so much as a refugee &mdash; scraggly beard, wild hair, ratty clothes &mdash; and nothing to carry my stuff in but a filthy pillowcase. The only way I felt sure I could get to their place without being interfered with was to slink through the poorest neighborhoods, where, as it turned out, I saw no one: they've all disappeared, or else shut themselves in against the world. When I finally arrived, my friends were already packed, and after giving me minimal instructions on the care of the dog, they were on their way immediately, saying they would keep in touch while they were gone. But the dust was still swirling in their wake when I began to wonder if they actually intend to come back, ever. Well, whatever they're planning, it's only the dog and me for now, or for as long it takes one of us to have to abandon the other. Such an optimist, I! The dog sleeps most of the time, and will be little trouble, unless he gets sick; nor will I be bothering him in any way &mdash; I don't sleep much when I'm working, and I plan to continue that. Meantime, the place is crammed with food, enough to last for months. Whether we'll remain unmolested that long is of course another matter. What's happened around here is anybody's guess. I've been buried in my work and paying no attention, but I have the sense that everybody's either already gone or leaving &mdash; which of course makes me think I should do the same if I have any sense. But I don't have any sense, or none of that kind. Never did. Pretty sure that's how I got this job. Whatever the case, the dog's too old to make any kind of trek, and, now that we've become acquainted, I feel he's got a claim on me, so I can't leave him behind &mdash; not that I'd know where to go anyway, except after my friends, and there's no telling which way they're really headed, no matter what they told me. There ought to be a wise saying about such a circumstance, but I can't think what it would be... So maybe let's start off with a little feast: I've been eating like stray mutt for weeks, just like always when I'm on this kind of binge. The writing life may look romantic to a civilian, but for me, often as not, it's a forced march over rough terrain, and most of the time I have no real idea how long it'll last: one day I suddenly get to the end and pitch on my face &mdash; the only time I sleep properly is right after a long slog like this one (which, I remind myself, isn't finished!). The move here might break things up some, but maybe not.   I can see real weather from up here! Just now, exploring with the dog, I found there's a parapet running along this whole face of the house, up high on the lake side. Out there, coming down from the mountains on the other shore, there's a great slash of black cloud, lowering, dimming everything behind and beneath it. The dog's staying inside, whimpering, but it looks to me like the storm will pass off, up the lake &mdash; to the east, best I can reckon. Down from here, there's a wall along a gully that empties into the lake; at the property line, as I guess, the wall turns right and curves around and back up, enclosing all the buildings on this hill. If I knew anything about fortifications, I'd say this place was once a citadel; the tower up near the top of the gully may have been a watchtower, once upon a time... Huh. Just the kind of thing a scribbler would think. For fun maybe the dog and me'll play fort and be brave soldiers holding off a siege. Except for the brave part and the soldier part, the rest may turn out true...   Long time since I've been inside a home as fancy as this; can't remember ever actually living in a house so big. The dog's led me all over, the past couple days, but I'm still not sure I've found every room. And there are some places the dog just won't go. Writing project's reached a resting point, which is good, because this latest development in my life story seems important to document. No word from my friends the dog's people, but he doesn't seem worried, and there's time yet before we need to start fretting about them. Or us, for that matter.   My old friend and I grew up together; we fell out of touch and then found each other again more than once over the years. Straight out of school he had a big success, then ups and downs like the rest of us, but on the whole he's done very well &mdash; and always tried, however he could, to spread his good fortune around. His mate, whom I only just met as they were leaving, was very kind towards me, if a little distant, maybe just shy. They really seem devoted to each other &mdash; a nice change from my friend's previous companions, not one of whom did him any damn good. Every time we get back together I'm awed again by his passion for art. He turns every place he lives into a museum, just packed with unusual and original stuff, and with every object, even the most ordinary utensils, you can just tell he thought and thought about what he wanted, then deliberately chose a piece that did something to him, not just for him. Or so it seemed to me. I didn't always like what he picked, but always believed (or always did before) that I could guess what that something was, if I pondered it long enough. He never showed much enthusiasm for the writings I can't seem to stop churning out, although he never failed to encourage me to keep on doing it. Beyond the remote chance that what I produce simply stinks (ha ha), I get the idea he just doesn't trust words, or maybe only written ones. And now I think of this, I remember once, when we were quite young men, I accused him of hating literature &mdash; of course I was fishing: I wanted him to say that, on the contrary, he really admired my work. Instead, he laughed and admitted there was some truth to the charge: he found reading stories fun for a while, but then it all got to seem so perpetrated, faked-up, and for what? Entertainment? What's that for? But then he said &mdash; and I can't verify his exact words (we were very very drunk) &mdash; what really worried him was that text could be destroyed, but it never died a natural death, like every thing that lives. I don't remember what was said after that; we may have passed out, or his partner at the time drove me away for being a bad influence, I can't remember &mdash; in any case, I still cannot think of a thing to say back to that.   The dog slept with me last night; as I've said, he's old, and a little shaky in the hind legs. When, long past midnight, I crawled under the covers, he couldn't quite get settled on the floor next to me as he's always done before, but kept fussing and whining until I finally figured out that he wanted to be on the bed with me. So I hauled him up by grabbing him under the elbows and he settled between my feet, and in just a few moments he was snoring dedicatedly. It always takes me a long time to fall asleep, which is one reason I stay up so late, I guess. I had just started to doze off when the dog began to snuffle, his paws twitching like he was chasing something, or something was chasing him. I tried petting him, which calmed him as long as I kept it up, but as soon as I stopped he sank back into his dream and started wriggling and whimpering again. So I gave up trying to 'fix' him and just watched as his dream unfolded and imagined what was going on behind his skittering eyes. It was a gorgeous night, moonlight pouring across the floor at the foot of the bed &mdash; the whole rest of the world fast asleep, every creature except the nightbugs and predators deep in its own dream. Magic hour. Suddenly he jerked upright, aimed himself right at me, ears back, growling, his tail straight out behind him, quivering all over. In my calmest voice I asked him what was wrong, and I swear when he heard me speak, he smiled, silly with relief, wagging his tail furiously and cringing up to me. I got him settled down, which took a good while, and eventually he curled up against me, his back against my chest with my arm over him, and we both went right to sleep. It's stupid to think this, I know, but then it seemed as if the dog's unhappy dreaming passed to me. I was driving along a street with someone else, not my friend, and we had to slow for an intersection; a man on foot came toward us on my side, and I just drove right into him, running him down and speeding away. The person with me, whoever it was, told me not to worry, it was the only thing to do. But later in the dream a woman appeared and told us that the man was her brother, and she showed me why, though I can't remember how she did this, it hadn't been necessary to run him down: he was coming over to offer us help. My companion tried to argue with her, but I was devastated. And then it was my turn to wake up shaking.   It's hazy this morning, the mountains a mere sketch on the horizon, and the surface of the lake is empty, which is strange, because to my best recollection it was always busy with boats, ever since I came here. And now that I listen, I don't hear any roosters &mdash; every other morning they've been so many and so loud I couldn't stay asleep once the first one woke me in the dark...   The living room here has a high ceiling, and over the fireplace is a life-sized mask of a woman with a striking expression &mdash; lips parted and wall-eyed in trance (or ecstasy? or death?) &mdash; her head haloed in flowering leaves; on a hoop around her neck is fastened a tiny baby's face with wings behind its ears; and from this necklace hangs a rainbow of ribbons as long as my leg, like streams of multicolored blood from a severed head. Other objects here have this same double effect: they're exquisite but also shocking. On the wall opposite the mask is a framed print of a mother and her babe looking tenderly at each other, while behind them a city blazes so bright it might be in flames; in another image, the sun is just rising, a jeweled sword stuck into it almost to the hilt; there's a huge painting of a little girl's face, many times life-size, looking right at me with an unsure expression; outside in the yard, a grinning carved figure is twisted into an impossible position, and, nearby, a person emerges from a cocoon of stone, weapon in hand; and, nailed to the garden gate, wings expanded, a ragged clay owlet. I have enough experience in at least talking about such creations to be wary of reading too much into them, as I've been taught to think, or at least to say. Still, it's hard not to have a strong reaction to what seems to be happening in the moment depicted &mdash; a moment depicted just this way, I have to think, in order to invoke just such a response.   My friend and I had another friend, a musician, a singer. We were at school together; we met him the very first day. The three of us were inseparable from the first, even though &mdash; what am I saying? &mdash; because we argued all the time. Each found his match in each of the other two, because there was never anything that all three of us could agree on &mdash; and, I think now, none of us had ever until then been pushed so hard so intelligently to defend (and often, in my case, to discover) what meant the most to him. Of the three of us, the singer was the strongest in dispute &mdash; he could hold off us other two by himself, for a time, at least &mdash; while my friend who loved art was almost always the first to yield, perhaps because he felt he could not himself create but 'only' appreciate. Maybe; this may not be the best way to put it. We called him the critic, a term of abuse in our discourse, and although he smiled when we did so, as if indulgently, I could tell it hurt him. He also had the kindest temper of us all, while the singer could be cocky to the point of belligerence, claiming music was the purest art, because it did not require words or images to have its effect. I can't say I agree, but then I wouldn't, would I? In truth, each of us had his strength which could not be overthrown unless the other two ganged up on him, and for years, even after we'd left school and the heady atmosphere of study, we would make a point of gathering, somewhere, just to join our minds in battle. Good times. But everything flows, as some old crank said, which sounds like a song, and a sad one, have to be. The musician went off to war and was never heard from again; my friend the aesthete prospered in the world, but his personal life was one disaster after another &mdash; until now, or so I hope. I became a kind of mole, burrowed away under mountains of words for months and months at a time, only emerging when I was finished with some seemingly endless project &mdash; or it was finished with me, which was more what it felt like. This made all but the most fleeting relations with others pretty much impossible for me, which in fact I was not exactly unhappy about, being terribly shy, except with my two friends. And every social engagement utterly depleted me. The world made with others never seemed quite real to me &mdash; in company I learned how to manage, but often felt afterwards that I hadn't been myself: said things I didn't mean, played up to people I didn't really like, forgot or ignored those I actually did love or admire, made mistake after mistake, always dodging from one jolly or catty exchange to another, ever on the alert for signs of disapproval. Maybe it's the same for others, I don't know; writing lets me get every one of those back-and-forths just right &mdash; which didn't necessarily help the next time I was thrown together with others, but did calm me somewhat afterwards, when I could revise and revise... And so I find my present solitary circumstance quite agreeable &mdash; and more: an adventure, in pleasant surroundings for a change. The dog is affectionate in a matter-of-fact sort of way, and as I said he sleeps much of the time, so I am not often bothered by his attentions, which indeed he is most gentlemanly in offering. The castle, as I cannot help but call it now, continues to intrigue me; its story, I think, must be long and, well, enchanting. Even after days of exploring I know I have not reached to its full extent: a good deal more than I thought is underground. I've spent some time watching from the top-floor balcony, which in fact encircles the whole house, as in a true castle. The lake is eerily quiet. A few boats float here and there, but I think they're adrift: no movement on the lake looks like deliberate travel from one place to another. What has increased is the number of waterbirds gathering in the shallows towards the western end, off to the left from here. It used to be I'd only see one or two gliding down from behind the shoulder of this hilltop; I've never seen them flock like this &mdash; maybe they're holding a parliament, like in the old story... It's not really possible to see streets from parapet or window, but it seems to me that the noise is less now than when I arrived &mdash; the city-type hubbub of vehicles and machines, the general babel of a place full of people. I would swear there is more wind, whistling during the day and roaring at night. In addition, I think a change of season is underway &mdash; mornings are warmer, and by mid-afternoon it can get quite hot &mdash; which may in some way quiet things, though I'm not sure how... I don't believe I've paid attention to such things in a very long while: most of the time, whatever the season, I'm inside, working and working. But for now, the current project continues to hibernate, for which I'm grateful &mdash; I almost feel alive again, an actual person leading an actual life, instead of being always on the verge of falling ill, the way I often get to be, particularly near the end of a long slog. Now I remember! I dreamed about my lost friend the singer last night, but had forgotten until just now. There was a performance or ritual we had to prepare; he was unperturbed as we went about it, but I kept fumbling things because I didn't know how to do my part and was very agitated, and accused him of not helping me on purpose, of being a bad friend. And then, as this person never did in life, he accepted my accusation, and begged my forgiveness. I was taken aback, and felt I had gone too far, but just as I was about to start apologizing, the others for whom we were putting things ready suddenly appeared in the room, and began to berate us for getting everything wrong, sending us flying in every direction, frantic to please them. But then the dream dissolved in confusion and I woke up to the dog nuzzling my arm nervously &mdash; I wonder if maybe I was moaning or twitching, as when he kept me awake with his restless dreaming some nights back. And so one goes away, another comes; the worlds we inhabit slide over each other like clouds in the sky: day and night, winter and summer, youth and age. Springtime and harvest, the hunt and the feast, gathering and loosing, fighting and rest. What am I talking about? What am I thinking? Where is this coming from, these words and their rhythm, rise and fall, call and response? Idea and phrase, image and music, nothing and everything, all in between. I've got to get out.   So I went down to the lake, after much delay and indecision. Afraid of what I'd find, or wouldn't... I'm not sure it was a great idea: there's no one anywhere. The dog and I are the only &mdash; well, we're not the only creatures left around here; as I mentioned, the water birds have been massing at the end of the lake &mdash; that much I can see from the balcony. But once I was down in the streets beyond, it was eerie, the moreso once I neared the docks, and along the quay itself: the empty boats just bob and bump aimlessly, with no one in sight. I got so spooked I ran all the way back up here. The dog's philosophical: he recognized how perturbed I was and just followed me patiently, pacing back and forth with me when I couldn't keep still, until I finally turned my attention to him and stopped, plunked down on the floor, and let him sit in my lap, pin me down. He accepts my absent-minded petting, which calms me as well, and listens politely while I try to work out what to do. If I understand his what-we-used-to-call nonverbal communication, the dog's advice is to do nothing. If there's going to be trouble, let it come to us: we're fortified, we're provisioned, and we can see it coming long before it gets here. I put it to him that the others, who left, must have possessed information we don't, which he had to admit seems to be true, but such information can't possibly do us any good unless we know what it is, and we don't, so, until it or the danger it warned everyone about turns up, it makes better sense, to him at least, to wait and see. But what should we do while waiting? I asked him. He thought this over, or appeared to, maybe just to reassure me that he takes my distress seriously. At last he proposed that he take a nap, while I, should I not feel ready to join him, could make sure our defenses are secure, and then, satisfied of that, I might search out likely places where my friend may have left clues, either to what really motivated him and his mate to leave (in addition to, or instead of, the reasons they gave when they absconded), or where they (and everyone else) really went. This plan was so sensible I immediately felt better. The dog retired to his daytime perch, up on the back of the overstuffed chair, and let me know, with a last long look before he curled up, that he would take the next watch whenever I needed him to. I wish my friend had told me the dog's name, but I don't suppose it matters, since the dog doesn't know mine either: if one of us wants the other's attention, it's easy enough to get, with just the two of us here.   When we were boys, playing alone together, my friend and I would mount elaborate missions aimed at solving a mystery. Such a mission would often start when some otherwise innocent event or utterance made us prick up our ears, we didn't know why. But thereafter, in the game that was now afoot, we were unable to dismiss a feeling of unease, given the fact that, as we well understood, whatever everyone else understood was not, in fact, the case. And of course it would turn out that there was a major flaw in the running of things, and the welfare of the community &mdash; if not the absolute survival of humanity&mdash; was under threat. We knew well the stories of great sleuths of the past, but, for us at least, it was not their methods or skills or even consummate brainpower that were so inspiring, but rather their distrustful attitude toward appearances. Our axiom in every investigation we then pursued was: this isn't what you think it is. Whatever this looks like; whatever the experts say; whatever your own experience of life tells you; you don't (yet) really understand what's going on. My friend and I were never adversaries in this game. We both felt that the fiendish villain bent on destruction was an unsatisfactory, cheap perpetration on the part of the author of the tale: to us, if there was an opponent to be overcome, it was the entrenched opinion of powerful people &mdash; those who were absently (or deviously) referred to as The Authorities &mdash; though naturally the motives of the authorities could be dark as well as benighted. And evil, in our version of the story, was conquered by brilliance, not virtue, which was never our governing attribute. In other words, we were not players in some moral fable, but persons caught up in a real human situation. In any event, by the time we arrived on the scene, matters had reached a crisis; if we did not turn the tide of events, everything we held dear would be destroyed. Hardly an original plot, for boys of that age. My friend and I confided to each other that when we were apart we also tried to play this game with others, but never with much success: either that other partner was too slow, or too dull, or too competitive, or else really wanted to play a different game, one with fewer unknowns &mdash; or, more to the point, indeterminables. The kind of game we best loved could not be won outright, but was doomed to an inconclusive end, in which the opposing forces might be foiled for the moment, but never for good. Trying to explain to others why this was the proper end for such a game never got anywhere: they would ask, in effect, why even start a game that couldn't be won? aren't things hard enough? why manufacture that kind of grief, when we decide the rules? What's the matter with you? I'm reminded of this game constantly as I go through the castle: its walls covered with artwork, the view from the battlements, the maze of rooms with hidden doors and secret passageways (I've actually found one of those), and underneath it all, a dungeon of vast complexity and inconceivable extent. If I can keep my sanity in the face of total human solitude in a world that once sustained millions of souls, I might be able to... &mdash; do what? save whom? from what? Talk about inconclusive indeterminables! And then I saw it: my friend wants me to play the game with him one last time. He has gone to fetch supplies, or resources, or confederates &mdash; of whom I, after his mate, am the closest &mdash; or to gain intelligence of the enemy's position, assets, and strategy. Or all of these. I am to hold the fort, literally, to render it secured and provisioned for the hostile engagement that has already begun.   The first thing of which I am immediately certain: I need the dog for this. As I mentioned, he is old, and doesn't get around very well, though he's always willing to try if it seems that I really want him to do something. Except to go into the rooms he won't go into. Until now I haven't pressed the matter: it's his house, after all. And as I said, he sleeps most of the time, but that could be out of boredom &mdash; maybe all he needs just now is a Mission...   Our situation also bears some resemblance to the beginning of one of my writing projects: often I'm deep in the middle of an intense period of work when the germ of a totally different thing presents itself and demands my attention. At such a time I'll jot a few notes &mdash; to put the damn thing off, first of all, because I have work to get done &mdash; but also to keep from losing the idea, which like as not is just a feeling, as in our mystery game, and often the first words that come don't even begin to express what's luring me, so I have to lay down what I'm working on and give the new idea full focus until enough of the right words come that I know I'll remember when I return, and only then can I go back to work on what I was doing before. But often I'll be distracted, because in part of my mind I'll still be thinking about the new thing, which I'll have to keep open on the side just in case more of its important stuff comes up, and it almost always does. This straddling can go on for a while, and sometimes the new thing steals me away from the old thing &mdash; and once I never went back: that old project never did get finished, and it was very close to being done. I can't believe it isn't the same for everybody else, and not just writers like me, but everyone who goes from project to project &mdash; always more than one ball in the air, never (or hardly ever) the luxury of being able to work on just one piece from beginning to end. Maybe this isn't a bad thing; but it can be very frustrating, and I'm always worried, when I'm in this kind of circumstance, that the thing I'm working on is the wrong thing, and that the other one will get away from me if I don't &mdash; well, you get the idea. No wonder I have to live alone. But what I started to say is that I've got that feeling my friend and I would get just at the beginning of a new round of the game we always played. And the feeling's really strong: something is very wrong here &mdash; and this time it's not like everybody else is either oblivious to it or in denial. There is nobody else. Just me and the dog.","refugee.html"],

	["Rescue Plot","I wonder if it is the same with others as it was with me: I became a man all in one moment. Or rather, after that moment of my life, I understood that I was no longer a child. I do not believe it was the beating the Good Doctor gave me after Robenc reappeared, or the beating alone, that precipitated this transformation: quite simply I realized there was no other path but the one before me. The Good Doctor had to be stopped; the Historian had to be freed. This was the reason I was here; my whole life had led me to this place, this time, this mission. Nothing would or could stop me. My first thought, naturally, was to assassinate the Good Doctor. But then freeing the Historian would become impossibly hard, as I quickly realized. I also saw that I would never be able to perform this latter deed without help, and my first thought was Robenc. But how was I to contact him? My time was entirely consumed by my duties for the Good Doctor; were I to disappear from my billet, the suspicions of my fellows would be aroused, and I remembered the Superius Frater's advice to trust no one. Fortunately, the thrashing the Good Doctor had given me provided an excuse to visit the infirmary, which, although still within the compound, was not immediately within the compass of the Good Doctor's mistrustful gaze. And I was not feigning my discomfort, only its extent &mdash; I told him I could barely walk at all. He was of course much displeased that I was going, but he authorized the release, which stated that I had fallen down the stairs. Once in the infirmary, my pathetic appearance melted the heart of the matron, who made me her special charge and care. The surgeon was not terribly concerned about my injuries &mdash; the Good Doctor had made sure they would be consistent with a fall down the stairs &mdash; but he was interested in my lame leg, apparently something of a specialty with him. Between the two of them I found that I would be staying for a while, perhaps as long as a week, which would give me time to think and plan. I felt sure that the Historian's examination would be suspended until my return &mdash; I strongly suspected that the Good Doctor had been exceeding his authority in some way, even before he lied to Robenc, and wanted as few witnesses as possible to this particular interrogation. He would, however, be most anxious to resume: Robenc was unlikely to leave this matter alone, and the Good Doctor wanted to break this stubborn man's spirit before Robenc could mount any serious interference. And then on my third day, an unexpected gift! Robenc himself appeared at the infirmary to visit an old friend who had been admitted the night before, and given a bed next to mine. At first Robenc seemed not to notice me, but talked jovially with his friend, evidently an old stratiotés with whom he had once shared duty. But after a time they both looked around carefully, and, determining that neither the surgeon nor the matron was anywhere about, turned to me. 'Brother Egderus,' Robenc said. 'You gave me a signal the last time we met, in the office of the Good Doctor. Did you eavesdrop on our conversation?' I nodded. 'And is the Historian in the Good Doctor's custody?' Again I nodded. 'I must release him, and I need your help.' At first I could not find my voice. 'What can I do?' I finally croaked. Robenc smiled and turned to his friend. 'You see, Aric? I told you Egderus would be with us.' He looked at me again. 'Aric was stationed at Mountain House for seven years. I am surprised you did not recognize him. He says he remembers you well.' I looked at the man between us in amazement. His brownish hair and beard were grizzled now, but I faintly recalled those large hazel eyes, and that expression of skeptical amusement with which they now regarded me. 'He is now sub-praetor in my lord's Bodyguard.' 'I get to hold my master Robenc's train in ceremonial processions,' Aric growled, baring his teeth affectionately at Robenc. 'I haven't been so bored since before Phylax Gig started chasing you young chickens about the hills and vales.' At last I remembered him, and bowed my head in mute apology. 'That is another story,' Robenc continued, 'which you may persuade Aric to tell you, if you two run out of reminiscences about our old home.' He clapped Aric on the shoulder, but neither man's eyes left my face. They seemed to be waiting for me to say something. I could only repeat, 'What can I do?' 'I will allow Aric to explain. Now I must be going, and I dare not return. But I will send messages to Aric here. Farewell, Brother Egderus. Your courage will be needed.' Then he was gone. Aric smiled at me a long time before speaking. Finally he said, 'I remember you well, Brother Egderus. The lads thought you were feeble, you know, and not just in the legs. You seemed so timid, and you stayed in the house all the time. Very crafty, Brother Egderus, but you didn't fool me, then or now.' He shifted uncomfortably in the bed, trying to adjust the too-small infirmary gown on his burly shoulders. Then he leaned towards me. 'You're going to need all the craft you have, as well as that courage Robenc seems to think you're full of.' 'What are we to do?' I asked. I did not like the way he was still half-smiling at me. 'In time, little brother. In time. We aren't going anywhere just yet. And I have to test you first.' 'What do you mean?' 'You've impressed my master Robenc in some way, but I've always thought him rather quick to believe his first impressions, if you know what I mean. I don't have his noble bearing, nor his rugged good looks; I'm not nearly so tall. In other words, I don't strike myself as an important person. Nor do you, little brother.' 'I never said &mdash; ' 'I know. You never said a lot of things. Back there at Mountain House, when Phylax Gig came back in pieces, you never said you'd seen him on the road the day he disappeared.' 'I told Robenc.' 'You did? Now why didn't he tell me that?' 'Then how did you know?' Aric sat back and regarded me for a moment. 'Very quick, little brother. You're doing well.' 'Is this the test?' 'It's all the test, little brother. Not a moment of your whole stinking life that ain't the test.' 'I am not your little brother.' Again that half-smile, that almost mocking glitter in his eyes. 'Robenc said you were scrappy. Well, not many people have the nerve to talk back to a personage as imposing as our master Robenc. However, I'm not impressed.' 'Must I impress you?' 'As I said, you're doing well. But it's hard to trust a person who allows everyone to think he's a simpleton when he's not.' 'It's hard to trust anyone, is it not?' I said, meeting his gaze. 'Ah! So you've learned that, have you?' 'Advice from the Superius Frater, when I left Mountain House.' 'Oh?' '&quot;Trust no one,&quot; he said.' 'Did he? Well, then I guess he ought to know.' 'What do you mean?' 'Shall I tell you? Shall I tell you our secret plans? Shall I trust you?' 'You must be very bored if this amuses you.' His nostrils flared, and a kind of fury kindled in his eyes. 'Don't think I'm a fool, little brother. This is not a joke, and I'm not here to play with you. My master Robenc believes this Historian is another important person like himself, and so he wants to rescue him. I'm sure this strikes him as noble and heroic, but it will entail considerable danger for me and for you if we proceed.' 'I'm not afraid of danger.' 'I believe you, and this worries me. It would not be the first time my master Robenc confused recklessness with courage.' 'Nor am I reckless.' 'Then what are you, little brother? What's this all about to you?' 'What's it all about to you?' 'Fair enough. Doing my duty is a matter of pride to me. I make it personal. If I can also minimize the damage to my commander and myself in the process, so much the better. Are you answered?' 'For the moment.' 'Then answer me.' 'And why must I? Is it not enough that your master Robenc has asked for my help?' 'That does not make you my master, little brother,' he said, though the humorous light was back in his eyes. 'But I see you will not be bullied. Very well. Perhaps I will have to betray my master's confidence before you will trust me enough to betray yours.' 'What do you mean?' 'My master Robenc will never tell you, and may not admit to himself, that what's driving him here is that he hates the Good Doctor and wants to bring him down &mdash; ' 'So do I.' 'Do you, little brother? And is that just because he likes to dance on your ribs? Is that enough reason to ruin a man's career, to destroy him, to make his life not worth living? If all you want is to get back at a man who beat you up, I can arrange for some of my lads to stomp him good some night on his way home &mdash; simple, clean, and done. That is not what my master Robenc wants to do.' 'Nor I.' 'But why, little brother? That's the only question I need an answer to, and then the test is over.' 'The man is evil and he must be stopped.' 'Stopped from what? Is this Historian your boyfriend or something?' Before that day, this question would have completely destroyed my composure. As it was, I certainly must have reddened, for Aric's eyebrows went up. But he also waited to see what I would have to say. 'You know what this man does. If you do not understand why he must be stopped, no one can explain it to you.' I continued to look at him, watching his eyes as he weighed his decision. At last a slow smile spread across his face. 'My master Robenc is not the only one to be impressed by you, little brother. Or would you rather I not call you that, now that you've passed the test?' I realized I had been holding my breath, and now let it out. 'No,' I said with a little laugh. 'I don't mind it, the way you said it just now.' He reached over and took my hand. 'Very well: Little Brother it is.' 'Now tell me what we must do.' 'You must prepare some damaging documents and give them to Robenc.' 'What?!' 'Before my master can free this Historian &mdash; listen: we only have your word that the Historian is actually in the Good Doctor's loving care. We must be able to prove that the Good Doctor is deliberately disobeying the Golias.' 'I can maybe send for my work &mdash; though I cannot walk, I can still write. The task I had yet to complete was a session with the Historian.' 'Ooh. That sounds very good.' It was not to be so easy. Naturally my master would prevent any documents from leaving his office, which eliminated my sending for my work: there would be no way to do that without arousing his very keen suspicion. But the next day one of my more sympathetic colleagues came to visit me, and I persuaded him to send me matériel &mdash; pages, a stylus, sand &mdash; and then began to reconstruct from memory the last examination the Good Doctor conducted on the Historian. Aric wanted me to give him each page as I was done with it, but something told me I should keep my work with me until it was completed. This annoyed him more than anything else, because it was tiresome for him to just sit and watch me write, especially at the beginning, as I gradually rebuilt the interrogation in my memory, and required him not to bother me so that I could concentrate. But when I had finished making new notae from which to render the realization, I told him we could converse if he wished. By then he was sulky. 'Oh, I see. Now the little brother has time for his friend Aric, who is about to get him out of this evil man's grasp. Now we can converse.' 'Silence is just as good for me,' I said breezily. 'If I do not have distractions, I can make this look really beautiful.' '&quot;Beautiful&quot; isn't what we're after, little brother.' 'I know what will help. Tell me what happened to Phylax Gig. You must know, even if Robenc does not.' He looked at me uneasily. 'Why do you want to know that?' 'I'm trying to keep you amused.' 'Well, it's not an amusing story.' 'Tell me anyway.' Aric was silent for a moment. 'Robenc did find out what happened, he just didn't know what to do about it.' 'I don't understand.' 'The lads and I weren't pleased with Phylax Gig, there at the end, when he lost his grip. He wouldn't speak. He'd only grunt and growl, like an animal. We thought it was the drink finally getting to him.' He stopped, thinking. 'Was it?' 'No. Leastways we didn't think so after a while.' 'Why?' 'Well, because he wasn't drinking anymore, that we could see. I mean, he may have had a secret stash somewhere, but he had no need to hide it from us. Or anyone. No. Something happened to him, or he saw something, and he just snapped.' 'That explains everything.' 'If you're going to keep interrupting, I won't tell you the story.' 'Sorry.'

	["return","On a mountain, at dusk, deep fog thinning. As it clears, across from me, a taller peak, near-full moon coming up behind. A flash to the side of me: there, a falls of water, at my level, shining &mdash; and, from above, the River of Stars dropping into it out of the dark. Moon pulls clear: I know that mountain. On its top, a tower, falling down &mdash; I climbed that tower, often. I remember more: a path goes over the far side, down to the lake. The House at one end. Start tomorrow.   Cannot sleep. Every move to set up camp, a sharp image: his hands, his voice, teaching me how. And then, as my fire starts to catch: I am looking from a hiding place; he feeds twigs one by one into young flames, then small sticks, making a pyramid. It begins to glow: he stops moving, gazes into it. His attention shifts; I draw back. He turns his head slowly... looks right at me. A moment passes. Then he lifts his hand, beckons. Now my fire is going, and I gaze. A different scene: glare of sun on deep snow. We've set out for wood, across the lake, iced solid. He plunges, knee-deep in the powder, pulling me on a sledge, his bag of tools on my lap. We head for the far end, where birch and young pine crowd the margin. I'm laughing, he leaps and charges, clowning for me. Then, beyond him, a cloud of steam. I point, shout. He just capers more madly. Then he sinks past his waist, the sledge rams his chest. I pitch over him into soggy slush. I scrabble to get behind him, I'm screaming, I pull and pull on his collar, but I cannot move him. He rouses and flails, yells at me to back away, we'll both go down. I fetch a long handle, he gets the other end, inches up onto solid ice, slithers away from the hole. Staggers to his knees, grabs my shoulder, pushes up to his feet. No wood that day, so no fire when we get back to the House. He wraps us together in everything we can find; I fall asleep against his chest. But I'm too small to warm him. His legs never work again. I scavenge what little wood I can; he becomes very ill. Day after day after day. The misery is appalling. Suddenly it is spring. The birds get up their racket, squirrels chase through the woods. Briars turn green, make flowers then berries, and we feed ourselves again. I learn to work the traps, fish in the lake, to use the sling, and knock down a slow bird then kill a young coney. He rigs the sledge with wheels, to get around the house; I clear a path to the sunporch. He teaches me to plant; in early summer we lay a table beside the lake. For a while it is very good with us &mdash; for all we know, the last ones left on earth. Those words come from him. Young as I am then, I know what it means. Different now, of course. Evening, after supper, sun going down. He talks about before he found me in the woods. His friends, his family, others, all elsewhere, unreachable. We sit long after dark in the ruin; even I can tell it was once the palace of a king, or a race of them. I see his face, lit from the side, eyes fixed in that other world; the music of his voice, as he summons the ones he knew into this unpeopled place, where everything he loved was taken away from him.

The stars at last are kind, the moon no longer a face after deathblow; the earth opens, one pore at a time. Go thy ways, little one. Time rises through you, a shoot through a fallen leaf.

	["ridiculous happenstance","According to a clearly corrupt but nonetheless plausible variant of this Writing, the Golias himself, early in his reign, put down a rebellion in a defiant village in the mountains. When the fighting was over, the inhabitants were herded into the town square, whereupon the ringleaders were 'tried' for treason, and a sentence of death pronounced upon their alleged captain. Disdaining to carry out the sentence himself, the Golias commanded the first able-bodied citizen upon whom his eyes alit to behead the man on the spot. That citizen, the town smith, seems to have been this Author's father (or grandfather, or great-grandfather). From that moment the only employment the former smith or any of his family could find was that of executioner, whose duties at the time also comprised non-lethal punishments such as amputation, branding, and flogging, as well as the dislocation of joints and breaking of bones &mdash; hence, perhaps, the waggish (but frightful) cognomen 'Bone-Snapper'.","ridiculoushappenstance.html"],

It will be awkward, these extra hours in each other's company, when we have already in effect said our farewell. But if we are not *old* friends, we are yet patient with each other from deep familiarity, not to mention shared suffering, so together we will find a way to spend the time. I am fortunate to have no other duties pressing: my colleagues have been most thoughtful, leaving me in peace whilst I performed the last things. Indeed, they have treated me as one who is ill with a catching fever, and now that I turn my mind to it, I sense the hand of our dear abbas in keeping them away &mdash; as much for their protection, it may be, as out of consideration for me. No doubt they regard me as possessed, or like one in the implacable grip of an amorous obsession, which is the more apt analogy. I have been under a powerful enchantment, one that only the combined authority of the entire Conference could command to be broken. Even so, I can only be dissevered from the body of my beloved: long ago the true object of my devotion took up her proper residence in my heart.

	["Scholar's Apology redux","I sit in what was long ago the library of this old, old place. Now it is merely a storeroom, where commodities on their way here or there are permitted to rest for a while until they commence their journey elsewhere. Although the room is drafty, its little fireplace still works, and I commandeered the long table beneath the window, so that I could look out over the lake, as I bound up the archives for the courier to take away. This task I finished late yesterday afternoon, just as the first soft flakes of snow began to drift down into the dusk. 'The lake was like a glass, reflecting the tawny rocks tumbled on its opposite shore, and a sky the color of parchment. Before tying up the final bundle, I stopped, sinking into that same utter stillness, my sad labor all but complete. The fever of excitement that seized me the moment I discovered the archives at last granted me release, and for many long moments I merely stood before the window, possessed of such equanimity as I had never known in my life.   and not only because of my misadventure with the Council, the abbas has assured me. It seems that the Conference itself is undergoing some kind of painful self-evaluation, imposed from above, requiring it to justify some of its cherished projects, and, according to rumor, its cost vis-à-vis the service the Conference claims to provide to the institutions that support it. Thankfully, I know nothing more than this &mdash; once again, our abbas has shielded us from entanglement in troubling matters about which we can do nothing but fret, a shelter for which I am deeply grateful at this distressing time. Were he to confide in me (which I doubt he will, and hope he will not), I might better understand the feeling of dread that runs through the life in this House just now, though I suspect it would not be eased but rather intensified by such knowledge.   As I think about it, I wonder at being chosen, by whatever agency, to revive these old writings of creatures we will never know in any other way. So far, their revenance has failed to be a boon either to their memory or to us, certainly not to me. But the story is not yet over, I feel, and may have only begun. This thought brings on another. Like the stories they recount of lives long passed away, this gathering of texts itself has a story, in which I have played a part, though that part is soon to come to its inevitable end. And of course each Writing in the archives has its story. And so on. No end of stories and their stories. =====[lacuna?]=====   It might be helpful to give some account of myself, since I have become a character in the tale of the archives. I believe I can do so briefly, without too much trying your patience, dear myReader &mdash; to use the old form of address &mdash; whoever you may be. I know nothing of my origins; no doubt there is a record of my donation to the community I have served my life long, but I have never gone looking for such a record, and in any case am incurious about its contents. My earliest memory is of carrying documents from one place to another in this very room, at the whim of our eccentric librarian. When I served him he was old and very forgetful, and would often make me relocate the same document more than once in order to 'help it find its proper place,' as he expressed it. If there was a method to his arranging what was then an extensive collection, I could not perceive it, and if I grew impatient or dared to question him about it, he would answer me with a savage thrashing. I also remember toiling at what was called copying off long passages of exemplary documents &mdash; is that not an odd locution: 'copying off'? So dismissive, as if it were a mere exercise in dexterity &mdash; which, now I think upon it, it must have been, for we were required to work at speed, and our mistakes and inaccuracies were punished, but I hardly think the artifacts of our labors were retained.... This took place in the old scriptorium, once the room adjacent to this one, where now the heart of all our logistical systems hums and throbs; that room communicates (again the archaic idiom!) with the refectory and the entry hall. Now, of course, no scriptorium is needed for the creation and copying of documents: it has been banished from our lives along with the exasperating chore of teaching clumsy youngsters how to do so by hand. But it was in the scriptorium that I learned to read closely, to penetrate the mere declarations in a Writing to the mind that formed them; to nose out every nuance, find the balance of each sentence (as with a weapon), to feel its music; in short, to hear the author's voice in the words &mdash; to 'ken his text', as my old teacher would have said. I am being shadowed by a ghost of our elder language, who insists on interposing between my task and me, like the cat who haunted the scriptorium when I was a boy, and who was ever noodging in beneath my elbow to get a scritch between her ears, or else sprawling lasciviously across my desk when I was struggling to concentrate.   In time, I found a place in the society of this House: teaching was a great joy, and I was ever delighted when my young scholars responded with enthusiasm to my elucidation of the ancient writings. As a student myself I had been rather lazy and glib, but when I studied these texts anew in order to prepare my lectures, it fired a deep fervor in me that I could not help but convey to them. At the same time, a similar scholarly zeal had erupted in the wider world, from which we had been for the most part sheltered, both by our remote location and by our abbas, a man only slightly older than myself, who strongly believed that such roil threatened the peace of our community, and who enjoyed to keep a secret more than most, if the truth be told. Many of my younger fellows chafed under his restrictions, and not a few left to improve their lot at the Temple School in the City, where, according to what news reached us in our sleepy little corner, great discoveries were being made. I was neither so young nor so restless; my own province of study had by that time become fairly established with me, and all the resources I needed in order to pursue that study were close at hand &mdash; in short, I was complacent and averse to disrupting my comfortable life. I had made a few small contributions to the New Learning, as it was called, in the form of brief essays that described my personal experience in teaching the next generation of scholars. But until that point I had published nothing that could be said to break new ground in the field of my research, and in truth at the time I felt no burning ambition to emulate my theoristic colleagues. I read others' writings &mdash; in haphazard and indiscriminate fashion &mdash; but never found myself compelled to add to or to argue with their work: indeed, the main reason I read theory of any kind was to stimulate my own thinking, which to me was sufficient good in itself. That is, I did not read critically in the usual sense of the word &mdash; to validate or refute another's argument &mdash; but instead to appropriate images and analogies that stoked my imagination, irrespective of their merit or usefulness for what the world would regard as established and reputable scholarship.   And then the archives came into my possession. At the beginning of my presentation to the Convention I gave a rather coy account of how that came to pass, in the hope of stimulating interest in my topic, much as I would do with my young pupils at the beginning of a lesson. I had anticipated that questions =====[lacuna (redaction?)]=====   As I am merely passing the time until the courier arrives, and have no intention to preserve this jotting, I do not think I will be violating the terms of my Censure by writing down here the actual =====[lacuna (redaction?)]=====   For some time I had felt a presence watching me, standing outside in the dark, gazing through the curtain of falling snow into the golden room where I examined each fragmentary remnant of my work on the archives: drafts, lists, diagrams, maps, all of them defaced with the woundings of second thought &mdash; corrections, insertions, strikethroughs, boxings, arrows, and other miscellaneous scribbles. Just as I gathered up the last of these scraps, with the intention of pitching them wholesale into the fire, someone stamped heavily on the platform beyond the outer door. At first I thought it must be the courier, but then was sure this could not be, since the roads were closed and the snow was still coming down like the lowering of a great shroud. I peered through the glass and saw a snow-covered figure standing with his back to me, looking towards the lake. When he felt my eyes upon him, he turned and pulled back his hood, smiling in the light from the window. It was the the same sturdy fellow who traveled with me for a short while during my sad return from the Convention. I immediately unbolted the door to let him in. 'Well met, my good friend!' he boomed. 'I am most grateful to find you still at work on this brutal night. No, no &mdash; please don't fuss. I shall be well just to stand by your fire a few moments, to warm my old bones.' He assented to my bringing him bark tea from the refectory, which took but a few moments, as I had just prepared some for myself. When I returned, I found him perusing my cast-offs with interest, though he stood back so as not to wet them with melting snow from his hair and beard. He took the mug from me with both hands. Our eyes briefly met; his expression seemed full of grief, and he quickly looked down into the steaming brew and bent to take a sip, then turned back to the table. 'Last decisions, is it?' he asked, gesturing at the scattered pile of scraps. 'What to send, what to keep?' 'What to burn,' I said, surprising myself with the harshness of my tone. Again he fixed sad eyes upon me for a moment, but then he laughed. 'Show me,' he said, backing away to make room before the table. In moments I was deeply engaged in explaining each snippet and shred, picking one up, then another and another, adjusting their sequence and pattern of arrangement, even scrawling more markings on the nearly illegible palimpsest of past work. His concentration was complete; he took each artifact from me carefully, as if weighing it, turning it this way and that to follow the meandering text, then nodding when he had discerned what he sought from each object. At last I came to myself. 'I ask your pardon,' I said, my face hot, 'you cannot possibly be interested in &mdash;' With a sharp look he silenced me. 'You cannot know how interested,' he said, with bite in his voice. Then, more gently, 'I thank you for breaking your mind to me concerning your work. What you have given to the world is priceless, even if, as yet, the only persons who perceive its true worth be in this room, and nowhere else in the five kingdoms.' =====[lacuna?]=====   By then it was very late. The storm continued unabated, and my companion dozed off on the bench by the fire. The next thing I knew, I raised my head to find myself sitting at the long table, just in time to see the first light of dawn touching the rocks on the lake's far shore. My neck was very stiff. My friend had disappeared, leaving no tracks upon the loading platform or the path. The scraps I'd planned to burn were gone.","ScholarsApologyredux.html"],
	["Scholar's Confessio","No one will find this. What can it mean, to write something no one will find? In my case, the reasons for hiding this collection of musings and memories will be all too obvious to my peers (if any survive) or former colleagues (to whom my existence, if any are aware of it, would be at most an annoyance, like an unpleasant smell). Let us just say that my contemporaries and those who follow shortly after are better off knowing nothing of this account. I did consider crafting this Writing as a cautionary tale, but there is nothing to be gained &mdash; no insight that might edify, no warning that would avail. For myself, I cannot yet restrain my emotions, though I hope in time I will learn to live with my fate, if that is what this is. In any case, there is nothing I can do, nothing to be done, no help &mdash; for me, for anyone, ever. Perhaps that is the lesson to be learned. If so, all the more reason to keep it to myself. =====[lacuna?]=====   .... And yet, as I think now, I have never been, nor will ever be, so happy.

And am content with that, as if there is a choice. There is a choice, of course, about being content, I mean; but happiness is another thing altogether.

Thunder had tracked us all morning, and just as we emerged from the forest on the bluff above the river, the clouds ripped open and we were drenched. After less than an hour, we came around a bend in the road and entered the courtyard of a small inn, where we would spend the night and then in the morning climb down to the crossing. Once I'd stowed my luggage in a corner of the dormitory, I wandered into the meditation hall and found a stairway that led up to the covered watch-platform, and from there I gazed across the broad river to the fantastic towers on the other bank. I had never seen a settlement so large &mdash; upstream, the jumble of buildings spread all the way to the horizon; in the other direction, the river mouth opened into an extensive harbor whose shores were lined with piers and boat-slips as far as could be seen. In the center of the harbor, like a jewel, sat the Isle of the Temple, the eternal fire blazing at its pinnacle despite the pouring rain. I nearly fell to my knees in gratitude for this moment &mdash; the moment of my life, surely &mdash; the culmination of my life's work. The moment of my life it certainly proved to be, in a way I could not yet imagine, and whose sudden recollection still catches me unawares, as I ponder this existence, and the perfidy of my kind &mdash; and my own silly innocence, that provided the occasion for such a bitter lesson. I returned to my lodging and spent the few hours before nightfall preparing my presentation. Indeed, I had already dedicated days and days to marshalling my my arguments, practicing my speech, even rehearsing my answers to the questions and counter-arguments I was certain I would have to face, and was confident I could foresee. ===[lacuna (redacted?): some days seem to have passed...]===   Shortly after departing the inn the next morning, I turned for a last look at the Temple and its precincts. Even though the sun had only just risen behind the majestic towers of the city, the air was warm, bespeaking a hot day to come, and a fine mist carpeted the harbor, blurring somewhat the image of the little islet in its midst. There was no hurry for me, of course, but I knew that my companions were anxious to cover as much distance as possible before the heat of the day fell full upon us, so I did not linger. But just before turning my face in our journey's direction, I thought I observed a traveler appearing at the inn's gate &mdash; I assumed to ask for entry, but I was too absorbed in my own thoughts to pay further attention. An hour or more might have gone by before I thought to glance back the way we came, but when I did I noticed the same traveler was following, walking at a pace to overtake us, which he did after a short time, passing up the line of slowly-moving wagons to the front. There I saw him speak briefly with our guide, who nodded and apparently welcomed him to join us, gesturing towards the carrier in which I rode. The newcomer stood on the berm until I drew alongside, and then, smiling in greeting, climbed aboard, where he sat opposite me on the bundle he carried with him. I could not tell his age, but felt sure he was somewhat older than myself. His bearing and complexion marked him as a man who spent a good deal of time out of doors, fending for himself. I nodded but did not speak, my heart still too heavy to initiate any conversation &mdash; indeed, I had little curiosity about him at all, feeling so sorry for myself as I did &mdash; and shortly once more I became lost in melancholy contemplation. It may have been another hour before I came out of my stupor. The sun had climbed midway to the meridian, the air was becoming close, and the man was maneuvering in his narrow seat, endeavoring to take off his outer garment, when his hand knocked against my knee, for which he begged my pardon. I nodded again, noting absently his inviting smile, but remained silent. Then our cart suddenly pulled up short; he was caught off-balance and fell almost into my lap. He apologized vigorously, and, perhaps to cover his embarrassment, leaped out of the carrier and jogged off toward the front of our train, evidently to discover the reason for our halting so abruptly. In a moment he returned to say that there was another convoy coming towards us on the opposite side of the bridge up ahead, and the two guides were negotiating who would cross first. It made little difference to me &mdash; I would be no less miserable sitting still than moving onward, and communicated this to him with a shrug. He looked at me a moment, and then, having made some decision, said firmly, 'Come with me.' I was surprised enough at this command that when he extended his hand I took it; after helping me out of the carrier, he led me to a small copse not far off, where he sat me down against a tree and began unstrapping his bundle, from whence he extracted a water flask and a small parcel of food. I was uninterested in refreshment and tried to refuse his offer, but he would not be denied, and after I'd dutifully taken a drink of sweet water and bitten into the corner of bread he tore off for me, he gave me a piece of dried fruit and bade me eat that too. All the while he smiled in encouragement, and something about his calm assuredness made me unable to resist his attempts to cheer me up. Indeed I did feel better almost immediately, and at last emerged sufficiently from my gloomy mood to thank him for his kindness. 'Please pardon if I presume, sir,' he said, 'but you are not unknown to me. The fact is, I have been following you: I wished to have a word, in order to convey my appreciation for your work.' I was astonished &mdash; though as I think now I might not have been, had my presence of mind not deserted me, for, once I looked him full in the face, he did indeed seem somewhat familiar. But at the time his declaration quite unnerved me, and I could not speak. 'I attended your address to the Convention, and found your topic fascinating. Do you mind if I ask you more about it?' Somehow I collected myself and responded that of course he could ask what he wished, but that I myself was no longer interested in the subject. I am afraid I was not very convincing in this prevarication &mdash; in fact it was an absurd thing for me to say &mdash; and he regarded me strangely for a moment, as if weighing what to do next. 'I take it...' he said, looking down and plucking gently at a patch of moss on the ground before him, '&mdash; forgive me if I am impertinent &mdash; I take it that the Council did not, perhaps, share my enthusiasm for your work?' At that moment I did not know what to do. The Council's ruling was explicit: I was forbidden to discuss the archive with anyone other than its members and its agents &mdash; and this man was, after all, a complete stranger to me. But perhaps the unexpectedness of the moment and his heartening demeanor made me less than cautious. He might easily have been an agent of the Council himself, sent to test my trustworthiness &mdash; and, truth be told, I cannot swear that he was not, though other interesting possibilities seem more plausible. Whatever the case, I admitted that the reception of my talk had not entirely matched my hopes, saying nothing of course about the Council's resolution, and asked that he interrogate me no further on the matter. The expression that dawned in his face, first of compassion, then of full comprehension &mdash; was most remarkable: I felt as if he had stood beside me throughout my entire inquisition, and suffered with me the same judgment. 'I will of course respect your wish,' he said quietly, acknowledging this with a bowed head, 'and ask no further questions. But, with your permission, I will tell you something of myself, so that you may judge the merit of my opinions.' I could think of no objection, and indeed my curiosity had at last been piqued by this odd encounter, so I invited him with a gesture to go on. 'Like you,' he said, 'I came to the Convention from a far place, where life seems simpler and not so treacherous as in that magnificent city &mdash; I for one am happy to be leaving it farther behind with each turn of our carrier's wheels. I too am a student of old things, though in my case it is artifacts, not texts, that I find of fascination. It could be said, of course, that a text is an artifact of a sort &mdash; I think you might agree with that proposition, would you not?' I nodded noncommittally. 'Ah! sorry! &mdash; I promised no question!' he said with a laugh. 'And in any case, I am not competent to argue the point very rigorously. I spend my life among old things, contemplating them, trying to discern their history, or rather, the story of their coming into my possession.' I could not help but interject that this was just like reading a text. 'Perhaps,' he said, delighted, 'but the difference is significant, I think. My task is simpler &mdash; but more difficult &mdash; than yours.' How so? I wished to know. 'The history that I seek to discern from one of my artifacts &mdash; insofar as it can be discerned! &mdash; is single. It cannot be transferred from one object to another. The artifact and its history are one. A text, on the other hand, exists in two places: first, it is bound to an object, an artifact &mdash; inscribed upon your tablet, for instance, or within the documents you displayed in your presentation &mdash; I'm so sorry! I'll not mention it again!' He appeared angry with himself, but I assured him that I hoped he would go on. The discussion we had entered was becoming quite enjoyable. 'A document is of course an artifact,' he continued, 'but the history of the object upon which the text is inscribed is only incidental, a matter of what materials are at hand with which to bind text and object together. The text itself is volatile &mdash; it may be inscribed directly from thought or copied from another document, for example, and can further be replicated and transferred to as many objects as one wishes.' But is not that process of replication and transferral part of the history of the text? 'No doubt,' he said, with a shrewd look, 'but the meaning of the text is not altered by the impress of that history, is it?' I could not stop myself from saying that the meaning of a text is always changed in its replication and transmission, because the meaning of a text is the combined understanding of the author of the text and its reader. 'I agree. Now you see what I mean about your task being easier but more complex than mine!' I had to laugh. I wasn't sure I accepted his premise that the history of an artifact is singular. And couldn't the history of the artifact be communicated from one person to another? 'Only by means of encoding that history into a text, which of course is then entirely transferrable. That is the nature and purpose of text.' But what other form can the history of an artifact take &mdash; once it is 'discerned' &mdash; than that of a text? He laughed again, holding up both hands. 'I am out of my depth,' he said, 'and cannot dispute with you. I confess that I am describing my feelings about the matter, rather than carefully working out an argument. It is why I have yet to make a presentation to the Conference &mdash; I could not hope to be taken seriously.' You cannot know that until you try, was my rejoinder. He straightened up somewhat and looked at me. 'This is &mdash; was &mdash; your first Convention, was it not?' And likely my last, I said with chagrin. 'You must not... take... their words to heart,' he said, as if in pain. 'They... know nothing... that matters. However that may be,' he went on, more easily, 'they could be wrong in rejecting your work &mdash; you did present material that was completely new to them, and, having no idea how to fit it into their scheme of things, they dismissed it as nonsense.' They did worse than that, I said, then shut my mouth. But he seemed once again to know exactly what I was thinking, what I was recalling with such shame. Only this time his expression of sympathy was mixed with anger. 'It was evil what they did to you,' he said, barely opening his mouth. 'But you will profit from it. Theirs is the true loss.' How did he know these things? He reached across and put his hand on mine. 'You are not without friends,' he said, looking earnestly into my eyes. 'The archive is lost &mdash; perhaps &mdash; but you are not.' With that he stood, and looked toward the bridge. 'It appears your guide has prevailed,' he said, and indeed the first of our wagons had begun to move again. He rebuckled his bundle and helped me up, and we walked to the carrier. But when we got there, he did not climb in after me. 'I have delivered my message,' he said, 'and must now follow another way. But do not forget me, or what I said at the last.' And with that he strode off in the direction from which he had come. Just then my carrier lurched forward, and I fell into my seat. By the time I regained my balance and turned around to look for him, he had disappeared.   As I pondered this peculiar encounter, more and more questions arose. Where was the man from? What did he mean when he said, 'I have delivered my message'? It seemed evident that some unknown person (or entity?) had sent him after me; what was not at all clear was why. 'You are not without friends,' he said. 'The archive is lost &mdash; perhaps &mdash; but you are not.' He spoke these words with a certainty, even a kind of authority, that was unmistakable. I began to wonder how this man knew so much about what was after all my confidential audience with the Council. Who were these friends he assured me I was 'not without'? As I reflected upon this question, I began to perceive the political potential of my attempt to introduce the archive into the discourse of the Conference. It took me quite some time to piece together an inference of what may have happened, but by and by a plausible interpretation took shape before me. The content and purport of the actual presentation I delivered at the Convention could well have been, as it were, immaterial. It was not unknown to me that there were factions within the Conference, and that the present Council was not entirely the impartial deliberative body its charter made it out to be: it comprised persons of differing opinions and experience, and, more to the point, divergent loyalties to various points of orthodoxy, each of which had its champions and detractors. The tension between these contending points of view was supposed to provide balance, which is a fine idea, but I began to suspect that it didn't work the way its framers intended &mdash; or not only that way. In the case of matter that fell outside the established parameters of doctrinal debate &mdash; such as the material that makes up the archive &mdash; the precedent has always been to submit a prospectus to the Council well in advance of the actual Convention, but I felt there wasn't time for me to do that. My plan, such as it was, woefully underestimated the complexity of the situation. That miscalculation was repaid handsomely, to be sure! When first confronted with the Council's decision not only to reject my conclusions, but to confiscate all my documents and forbid me to pursue this work further, I at first regarded Censure and Confiscation as a punitive measure, which, however harsh, was motivated not by malice or political considerations on their part, but by my not following the protocols, which were well known to me. I could not deny that my flouting of the rules was flagrant, but I had foolishly hoped that the excitement engendered by my discovery would militate against a literal application of the statutes. Having discovered I was wrong, I at first blamed my pride, and even accepted my humiliation as being in some way deserved &mdash; or in any event occasioned &mdash; by the arrogance that led me to misconceive to whom I was presenting what and how. But now I began to consider that perhaps the Council's actions had nothing to do with me, nor my revolutionary findings, nor even the irregular manner in which I brought my work before them. Maybe I was simply a pawn in some maneuver of which no one but the participants would have knowledge, of use only to check or countercheck some opponent's equally malevolent ploy. Naturally, I found this construal somewhat comforting. But it was pale consolation for my loss, and shortly a knot of anger formed in my chest that grew hotter by degrees as I brooded on the corruption of this scheme of things. How could anything fresh or creative in thought or research ever survive in such a poisonous atmosphere? This anger of course was stoked by the stranger's words, 'It was evil what they did to you,' and for a long while I fairly luxuriated in the feeling of self-righteousness that too often accompanies harsh treatment, justified or not. But eventually the sweetness of my rage began to cloy, and my heart told me this was not good enough. Fury would not carry me through the sorrowful task that awaited me at this journey's end, would indeed only deepen my misery, as there was nothing I could do to redress it. For the first time in my life, I began to feel keenly the truth of that old saying of the Remnant: Anger destroys everything. I looked out, and saw that the light was already softening into evening, and in the farthest distance I descried the beacon set on the mountaintop of my home. We would arrive by dusk. In the short time remaining before then, I returned to wondering about the stranger himself. The dialogue he set in motion was of keen interest to me, but as I recalled it, he put forth his proposition rather crudely, and just as we were getting to the heart of the matter he broke off, protesting his incompetence at debate. I had begun to look forward to the coming hours, during which we could indulge the scholar's delight in disputing. Not a scholar then, I concluded, or at any rate not a professional. A messenger from one, however, or from more than one. One of the factions in the Council? That seemed unlikely &mdash; 'You mustn't take their words to heart,' he said, 'They know nothing that matters.' This unquestionably took in everyone, not just members of an enemy bloc. What did he mean? That scholarship doesn't matter? Perhaps. But he was not simply dismissing the Council's words out of hand. He felt deeply, personally, the words he spoke. What they had done to me offended him &mdash; more, outraged him &mdash; so much so that he could not help but convey it to me. I may of course never know the particulars, but the truth of his anger was incontestable. However, this line of thought led back into the tiresome vortex of self-pity from which I wished to escape, and so I turned my attention to the stranger's disclosures about himself. He said that, like me, he came to the Convention from a far place, implying that he had done so more than once, perhaps on a regular basis. And yet, he also said, he himself had never addressed the Convention, but was apparently content merely to attend the exhibitions of others for his own edification. Or was he perhaps there to observe the proceedings for some other purpose? or the secret purpose of someone other than himself? My recent ratiocinations had cast a suspicious light on everything, I realized, not without amusement, and I again bethought myself of what the stranger had divulged about his own circumstances. He began our conversation by saying he spent his time with artifacts, as he called them, and I sensed this word had a special meaning for him. Objects with a story, he said &mdash; rather, a history &mdash; which he made it his undertaking to discover. Setting aside the issue we had taken on in our too-brief conversation on the topic &mdash; the relation of text to artifacts &mdash; I wondered what these objects might be: jewelry, clothing, tools, weapons, musical instruments? I was suddenly seized with curiosity about the stranger's artifacts, and the means he employed to extract &mdash; or discern, to use his terminology &mdash; their history. I could not imagine his methods except by analogy to the analytics I apply &mdash; or, rather, applied at one time &mdash; to the texts once in my care. And what form did this history take? He seemed to resist the notion that his process created a text; but if not a text, what did it create? And how was it communicated? Who benefitted? Himself alone? I began to feel a certain irritation toward my new acquaintance &mdash; or colleague, which he now surely was &mdash; for being so mysterious, almost deliberately obfuscatory, but at that moment our procession pulled to a stop at the gate of my settlement, and I realized how exhausted I was. I determined to think about nothing more until the morning. And with that I secured my luggage, returned to my room, and fell into a dreamless sleep.","ScholarsConfessio.html"],
	["Scholar's Diary","... If this document is authentic, then a complete reappraisal will be necessary. Our idea of that era is based upon the fact that the only writings we possess are lists, fragments of what might be poetry, and mere descriptions of exotic objects belonging to now-lost inventories. A preliminary reading suggests that in fact writing &mdash; and dare I say? &mdash; thinking very like our own existed at that early date. If that is true, however, several questions arise, with which I will attempt to grapple in a moment. The document came into my possession via a source I cannot name. The document itself is a copy, made very recently, and so of course it may be a forgery, a fiction. I was skeptical myself until I read it, and still harbor serious doubts &mdash; or more precisely fears &mdash; about its authenticity. My immediate problem is this: should I present this document to the Conference? The reasons for not doing so are only too obvious. I cannot make any claim for the document's validity without naming my source, and then presenting that source's credentials for scrutiny. It would also be necessary to find solid corroboration for the facts set forth in the document. Unfortunately, the extant evidence &mdash; lists, inventories, etc. &mdash; has already been examined thoroughly, and its interpretation is considered more or less settled. All this adds up to a resounding 'Don't be a fool!' &mdash; exactly what my colleagues will consider me if I go ahead and present this astonishing find without backing up my assertions. Had I come into possession of the document a year ago, I might have been able to rearrange existing evidence or unearth new material (I think I know where to look). Now, of course, there is no time. All my experience with the Conference, in addition to my native caution, tells me to wait. To present now could easily ruin my career. The next gathering of the Conference is three years away. That would be, it seems to me, plenty of time to prepare a good case for the document's legitimacy. But for that very reason, I must consider that sooner or later some of my colleagues might hear about what I am doing, and leap into the chase. Should that happen, I fear that the faint track left so many generations ago would become obliterated by their trampling feet. I must be free to pursue this without interference, wherever it may lead. And I strongly feel that this discovery, if it can be substantiated, could make my reputation, not only among my colleagues, but for generations to come. It begins to seem that the prudent choice is not to be prudent. I believe that if I present now, I will be in effect (if not in fact) laughed out of the Conference. If my colleagues become convinced that I am a crackpot, they may leave me alone. However, I must not hedge the presentation, first of all in loyalty to my belief in the document, and second because it will place me on record at this earliest date. And actually, I cannot imagine any more effective way to guarantee my colleagues' incredulity than to make a straight case &mdash; nay, to do so enthusiastically. So I will present.","ScholarsDiary.html"],
	["Scholar's Draft","...The document purports to be a perfect copy (translation?) of a manuscript first composed many generations ago, by the hand of an official whom we call Egderus Scriptor. Egderus is generally considered to be one of the first scribes (or the first to be so named) of the Goliadic Age, hence the epithet. We know of him because his name is found at the foot of what appears to be a list of slaves submitted annually, or at least at some regular interval, to the Golias (king or ruling strong man) of his area. ... In this new document, there is one term used by Egderus whose understanding is crucial. The word has been rendered 'Remnant'. In our usage, this means left over, waste, that which cannot be used, that which is discarded, forgotten, of no importance. In the wider world it designates people who, for whatever reason, no longer contribute to society, and who would be better off dead, or at least out of the way. And in a sense this last usage is most apropos, because of the 'position' Egderus occupied in his own society. The 'slaves' on his list have long been considered just such people, but it would more accurate to designate them as 'patients', for the Mountain House seems to have been some kind of hospice for hopeless cases, of which Egderus was the director. What is interesting is that Egderus does not apply the term to his patients. He always uses it thus: 'As the Remnant say', or 'According to the Remnant...' and what follows is usually an aphorism of the most sophisticated kind, as if the Remnant were a group of philosophers or sages who had garnered their wisdom over a long period of time. In fact it is possible to find in this Writing numerous antecedents to our own adages and saws in a slightly altered, but no less subtle and resonant form. At first I assumed this was either an idiosyncrasy, a private or perhaps a code word appropriated by Egderus to refer to the deities, although I would be at a total loss to explain the association in his mind &mdash; it seems an extremely peculiar word for describing divinities. But as I read on I could not dismiss the growing conviction that the Remnant referred to an actual group of living people with whom Egderus himself may have had direct or at least second-hand contact. If so, who were they, and whence did they come? More importantly, if the name is not a mere mannerism, and is a more or less accurate cognomen, of what were they the remnant?","ScholarsDraft.html"],
	["Scholar's Farewell","I wish there were more time. I feel I have only just begun the actual work, and suddenly I must give over to another, to you, whose care of the Archives will naturally be dictated by your own preoccupations. My curacy is over now. I have decided not to withhold anything, but instead to offer up the entire story, and let you decide how to proceed. Since I am to have no say in what is done with (or to) the Archives, nor any access to them after the handing-over, I have resolved not to serve badly my precious charge, in these last days, by making it difficult for my supplanter to come to the same appreciation of its worth. This may be made difficult for you by others. As the Remnant say, Beware the giver with nothing to gain. I urge you not to depend upon the benignity of your sponsors. Not to give offense, but the Council members surely regard this as minor research, or it would not have been entrusted to you: had your betters regarded this project as really important you may be sure they would have seized upon it themselves. On the other hand, they clearly believed the Archives important enough to take them away from me. What they most likely told you was that this would be a good project for their golden protégé, thus trivializing not only all my labor but the Archives themselves. Well. I put myself under their power, so I must not complain of maltreatment. But I will never forgive their light regard for the object of my life's work. And if you are wise, you will realize that you too have been trivialized in this maneuver. But neither their rhetoric nor their machinations can diminish the true value of the Archives in the slightest. Therefore, I exhort you not to broadcast too soon the excitement you will certainly feel once you have penetrated to the heart of the Archives. As you will see, this was my first mistake, if not my last. However, it was safer for me to err so than it will be for you, because the reaction against my enthusiasm has as it were poisoned the well for those who follow. I have every confidence that you have been told I am an eccentric &mdash; and worse, perhaps: a fool. That's as may be; I only ask that you come to that conclusion on your own, on the basis of the work I have done, not on the superficial pronouncements of self-important persons who have no idea of the value of this treasure. Think of what is most important to them: reputation among others like themselves. Then read the Archives. I once believed that bringing forth these writings from the remote past would make my reputation, gain me equal status amongst those august personages. You see what happened. Now consult your own heart. If you are likewise motivated, beware. An older man than yourself would perhaps not need this warning, having suffered a blow or two to his pride and found that the damage could be outlived. However, what is truly important here is neither your maturity (or lack of it) nor my pride. What matters is the integrity of the Archives, which will soon make a claim upon your loyalty, or so I hope, that will transcend these pathetic preoccupations. Now to the matter at hand. Included herein, in addition to the Archives themselves, are all my notes, abstracts, conjectures, drafts, and diagrams. I apologize for their disarray, but I was given only enough time to put the Archives themselves into some kind of arrangement. No doubt you will find this arrangement unsatisfactory, and will wish to assemble the writings according to your own sense of their proper presentation. I cannot stop you, but would plead that I had good reason for putting things in the order I did, even if I was not allowed leisure to write out in detail the rationale for that order. At some later date, when I have had time to regain my composure, I will send you any final thoughts I may have on the Archives, either advice based on my experience with them, or further meditations upon their significance. You will of course be entirely free to ignore these messages &mdash; if they are permitted to reach you at all. But please know that I hereby freely renounce any right I may have imagined I had to control their destiny. Having made their way through many generations to me and now to you, their capacity to survive can hardly be in doubt.","ScholarsFarewell.html"],
	["Scholar's Summary","History... myth... the remnant, preserved for a later generation, not as an exemplar, but an albatross. The world was all but destroyed. For generations, nothing but merest survival. Except, among the remnant, stories. Time rose like smoke away from the flames, in a line that bent this way and that, but ever ascended. Away, above. When light dawned again, the world belonged, as always, to Golias, the man of strength, numbers, technology. The remnant were identified, herded together, driven into the wilderness.

	["Scholar's Vision","I feel strangely elated. I will certainly grieve hereafter, but in the end it will not matter. One day I may chronicle the events leading up to my removal from the curacy of the archives, but today I can only rejoice &mdash; solemnly, to be sure &mdash; in an unexpected blessing that renders insignificant the utter ruination of my career: I have been granted a vision. The Archives comprise a dead body, which should be treated with all respect and gentleness, because of its venerable age, but after all what is it? &mdash; a corpse, a thing, less than that &mdash; the mere record of a thing: the thing itself absconded long ago, returning to its elements, no longer itself, a thing, but all things. What is left behind is what we are, what [illegible]. It was no writing from the archives that precipitated the vision; in fact, I am at a loss to explain whence it came, nor do I think it matters at all. But I can describe the occasion, which gives me pleasure to remember, and I am sure that I will often require the solace of this recollection. As had become my custom whilst working in the archives, I arose before dawn and went out to walk, intending to reach some promontory from which to witness the sunrise if the weather was clear, or at least to be abroad as the light came up and the world awakened. Snow had fallen heavily for the previous two days, preventing me from leaving the house, but on the third morning when I opened my eyes I could see the stars shining brilliantly in their watches, and I dressed quickly and with excitement. Outside it was very cold. Only the main road had been cleared, and the snow piled on either side reached nearly to my shoulder. At first I felt rather nervous, hurried, anxious for the somehow perfect perspective or vista to appear, willing to stop and listen, but worried about meeting others on the road, not wishing to see anyone, wanting no interruption, no distraction, nothing to break my mood of calm joy in anticipation. After a while, however, I started to shiver, and began to think of going back, but pressed on, still restless, not yet ready to give up. I stopped to look at ice masking a rock face, a stand of adolescent birches, a distant glimpse of mountains across the valley, already lit by the sun. A vehicle passed, then another, people going in to work. A third driver saluted me, but I was too late getting my hand out to wave back. I then decided to wave to everyone who passed, regardless of &mdash; well, of what? &mdash; whereupon I found myself moved, particularly by the thought of those who might think me strange; in fact I believed that most of these unknown folk would be happy to be so greeted, perhaps especially by a stranger. The meaning of the wave is this: hello sister, hello brother. But then I saw that the same could apply to the trees, the rocks, the snowbank along the side of the road. I even stopped and patted the snowbank, called it by name: Brother Snowbank. My eyes filled, and I began to sniffle. And to laugh. Of course it was silly, to be moved by sudden fellow-feeling for a heap of snow! But more profoundly silly, it seemed to me, was the grief and rage that had been devouring me since I was ordered to relinquish the archives. My brother Snowbank was the creature of only two days' existence, but he did not mourn or curse because he would be gone in two more. Nor did my sister Birches groan or complain under the weight of snow that bent them to the ground, but rather gleamed with joy in the rising light. I believed I was having a vision. But I was only being broken open for it. I continued onward, until I finally reached the giant weeping beech at the point where the lane joins the road from below. Of course there was no lane to be seen at all, the snow was much too deep. But I knew it was there even though its shape could not be discerned. In fact, knowing it was there permitted me to see its shape. A woodpecker drilled a distant hollow trunk, which echoed with a vaguely booming sound. A few birds sang, far away, but the silence in which I stood was as it were impenetrable, even when the wind blew through the pines, making them sigh, and the naked branches of leafless beech clacked together.... The sun breached the horizon. And the Vision struck me to the ground. I shall never be able to put this into words. But as I lay on my back gazing at the hanging branches, I began to see the tree as a writing, its shape forming a kind of character, or a word, or a sentence... And if we could only read the writing &mdash; yes, well then what? That is what I cannot explain. In a way I was reading the writing of the tree, the writing which was the tree, but all I understood was that it could be read. And then the realization spread to include every thing, its shape its story, all shapes' stories, all the language of this earth, even the shapes of roads in our minds, of houses torn down or fallen long ago, still standing proudly or derelict in memories, imaginings... and stories we tell...","ScholarsVision.html"],

	["Starling redux","The Starling returned to her mother, and told what she had found and done. Her mother became angry, and said she should have left the creature to die; now they would have to kill it themselves. The Starling asked why, but her mother would not answer; only she put her work away quickly and ordered the Starling to bring her to the place. When they came to the ravine, the creature was gone. Her mother found a way and started down, but when the Starling asked what she was going to do, her mother hissed at her to be quiet. For a long time the Starling stood alone at the top of the ravine, peering into the gloom, where she at first could see her mother searching the marks in the earth, then moving off downstream. The Starling noticed her length of line still hanging from the root to which she had fastened it, and so climbed down to the ledge in order to get it back; when she brought it up, she found that the bundle of mushrooms she had tied to the other end was no longer there. Then, as she was coiling up the line, she heard what sounded like deer crossing the little brook in the direction her mother had gone, and quickly clambered back up the bank. From there she saw some of the men pulling something heavy through the brush. Her mother came up beside her and told her it was too late: the men had found the creature and were bringing it home with them. When the Starling asked if the creature was still alive, her mother struck her to the ground, then turned and began running towards home. After a moment, the Starling got up and hurried after her. Not long after they arrived, the men appeared, dragging the moveless creature with them. Everyone gathered at the sight, and the Starling imitated her mother's expression of surprise and wonder at what the men had brought home. The men boasted loudly of how they had beset the creature and hounded it until it ran over the cliff. The Starling did not believe them. She walked boldly up to the creature and touched it, which made it groan and move its hand toward her; at this the men &mdash; and everyone else &mdash; jumped back in fright, because they had thought the thing was dead. Then her older brother joked that the creature must desire her for a mate, and the rest joined in making fun of her, her uncle saying that since this was true, the Starling would have charge of it thereafter, and they carried the creature into the rock room, teasing the Starling about seeing to her husband's needs, which made them laugh until tears came. Her mother put on a smile but did not laugh with the others, and the Starling observed that her younger brother regarded them both with a curious expression. There would be trouble, the Starling knew, and as soon as the rest were gone, she hit the creature again and again. But her mother came in shortly, carrying a basket and a bowl, and gently made her stop, and together they set the creature's broken leg and bathed its wounds. After a time, the creature's breathing eased, and they knew that it slept. Her mother was silent, but the Starling could tell from her presence that she was no longer angry &mdash; rather, her spirit was sorrowful, even tender, though the Starling wondered whether this came from her mother's feeling the creature's suffering herself or from something else. At that moment, the grandmother entered, and knelt down painfully beside the creature. She smelled it, and looked closely at every part of its body, from its feet to its face, upon which she gazed solemnly and long. She told the Starling to lift one of the creature's hands so that she could examine its lines and markings, but when she took it in her own hands she gave a hushed cry of pain, and reached for the other, and then they saw that both thumbs had been twisted out of joint. The grandmother gestured urgently for the Starling and her mother to reseat the bones and splint them in place. The creature stirred sluggishly but did not rouse, and when they were finished it gave a sigh and fell more deeply asleep. Then the three women sat back on their knees beside the softly snoring creature, weeping in silence and rocking, rocking.","Starlingredux.html"],
	["stars","Last night, feeling lost and desperate in my little attic room, I began to sing one of the hymns I learned as a young man in the city, a glorious anthem praising the deities one by one, which culminates in a rising chant joining our earthly voices to the choirs of immortals in a great burst of adoration for all the hosts of heaven. Well, it was just my voice alone, at the beginning and at the end, and if the deities were listening, they gave no sign, unless it was the dog I heard baying in a distant yard. My 'instrument' is much decayed, and I could not make it all the way through the longer phrases without gasping, but after a while I fell into the rhythm of breathing that the lines impose, and was able to attain all but the highest reaches of the melody without my voice cracking. This morning the stars are out, and although not all their patterns are familiar, I do recognize some constellations that I memorized as a boy, lying on my back in the field, those many nights when I could not sleep, repeating their magical names over and over. The sky behind the stars is deep blue-black, a rich cloth over which brilliant jewels were scattered by a careless hand &mdash; the hand, it may be, of a languid youth or maiden in love, or dreaming of it. Dear gods, I am that boy in the field again, or the young man just arrived in the city, drifting from one fantastic festa to another, as if all of life were like this, a dream just a little less glorious than the supernal metropolis conjured by that old hymn. My voice was pretty in those days, if not beautiful, but it was good enough to get me work, and friends, and adventure. I had some vague sense of the historical moment, just then and just there, but only enough to be able to debate energetically with others who knew no more than I. Being young, we had no sense of the pressure of the past, nor much ability to imagine the future beyond the next engagement. In my memory now, that time is a blur of brilliant colors, pierced by moments of fierce beauty, but these images are fragments without context, and it would be impossible to recreate any kind of sequence for them: I lived here, I lived there, loved this one then that one, sang this ditty or that psalm, but I cannot remember in what venue nor for what event. I recall great excitement, but not its occasion; deep sorrow, but not its cause. Most of all, I remember the color of the night: deep shadows looming over radiant streets, the velvety shimmer in the darkened room with only two people in it. Now the light is up, the sky is white, the stars are gone. I can see every ear of corn in the field on the hill across from me, and every mountain reflected in the lake beyond. A gaudy pink cloud trails like a long scarf from the neck of the tallest peak, and, in the near distance, one window gleams back at mine from the house beside the field. I cannot stay here, of course. But I will take this moment with me when I go.","stars.html"],
	["Steadfast Bone-Snapper","My grandson the scriptor, the triumph and hope of our sorry little family, has asked me to supply him with the story of my life, now that I can no longer perform my official duties; to tell him how it was with us, as he puts it, but mostly, I believe, to make me account for myself: to explain to him how I could persevere for so many years in my abominable occupation and still consider myself a proper human being. Very well. The work of my life has always been double: to perform the duties imposed upon me by my masters so that no complaint could be lodged against me; and to redeem our family name, so that we should no longer suffer the ignoble reputation with which my profession is benightedly encumbered. I will not at this time burden my high-minded but nonetheless loving grandson with the ridiculous happenstance through which our clan was thrust from its humble but respectable position in society. But I will tell how it came to be that I, through hard work and impeccable conduct, gained sufficient respect, within our sometimes small-minded community, that it became possible for him to be given the opportunity for a better life. In fairness, I must say that he has prospered in his work through his own admirable behavior, and also that his unconscious attitude of superiority to me is forgivable: first of all, it is no more than what everyone else believes; and second, as I have said, he is a loving soul in spite of the arrogance that seems natural to persons of his age and early attainment. My father, who served as executioner, grave-digger, and night-watchman in the tiny town where I was born, was able, through his acquaintance with others of his trade, to help me win an apprenticeship, when I was sixteen years old, in the Office I served as Rectifier for over thirty years. Before that, I was employed as his assistant, learning the tools, the knots, and the holds, helping with the carpentry, and practicing with his second sword on stray dogs. It is not amiable work, but it is essential. As long as there is evil done in this world, it must be redressed, or it will spread without check. And someone must perform that preventive function, however distasteful the thought of it may be to the refined sensibilities of philosophers and artistes. As the Remnant say, there are laws in this world, and we live by them. At one time, that world formed a coherent, intelligible whole; evildoers simply could not prosper, since it was their actions, not what they pretended or avowed they were doing, that people believed. Now, it matters less what a person does, or even what others say they think about it, but by what name the deed comes to be known, and once a person's action is given a title, this name can give shelter to scoundrels, whose position (in a society more concerned with what things are called than with what is actually done) prohibits such creatures from being reached by justice. It has been my duty all these years to be the point of the sword of justice, but that sword is simply no longer long enough. In my youth, if men and women did their work, the society we formed with that work was whole and sound. Those who did not do their work languished, and were gradually sloughed off by the rest. A scriptor, like my grandson, was not required, because everyone knew everyone else, and what they had done, and what others said they had done, and what to make of what those others said, because we knew those others as well. No documentation was required. A scriptor's work interferes with this power of discernment in people to decide for themselves what is true and what is not, based on their experience of the particular circumstance, of the event itself, and of life in general. The scriptor's work &mdash; the creation of a text &mdash; permits a tyrant to proclaim, 'This is what took place, this is what was done, as it is here written. Whatever you believe to be the case, this is the truth.' You cannot argue with a text, for text has no ears to hear, no mind to judge, no heart to forgive. You may say that a person who was not right there, when this or that happened or was done, cannot know the truth concerning the event or deed, but must rely on a second-hand account from someone who was. Yes, but if I know the person giving the account, and if I am attentive to how that person tells the tale, I will know what that person believes to be true, always remembering that a person can be wrong. But you cannot lie to a person's face without betraying this fact, and liars only get away with their crimes when their listeners are either distracted by their own desires or complicit in the crimes themselves, oftentimes both. You may object that some liars are so good at their craft that they can fool anyone. Not so: the first thing I heard in my mother's womb may have been her beating heart, but the second thing I heard was her voice. When I emerged from that wonderful place into this terrifying domain, the first thing I saw was the face of the midwife, a stranger. I have spent every day of my life since then reading faces and interpreting their utterance; and if I have not learned by now how to do that properly, whoever tricks me with a lie is entitled to whatever reward can be wrung from it.","SteadfastBone-Snapper.html"],

But then it is gone, and the haze hangs in the sodden air. Everything is soaked. Fire is impossible: nothing can be kept dry. I cannot bear this. None of us can. Our numbers dwindle, one by one &mdash; some leave, some die &mdash; and we hadn't many to start. Some of the young ones try to make plans, but only as something to do, something to keep from listening to the endless drip drip drip. Nowhere to go.

	["Superius Frater and Robenc","I had withdrawn to my little study off the refectory half an hour earlier. It was mid-afternoon, and I was trying to stave off the temptation to take a nap, a temptation which speaks to me more urgently of late, particularly after midday meal, and on gray raw days when I cannot get outside and walk away my drowsiness. This past winter has been brutal, but at least the cold kept me awake during the short days, and sunset came early. Now the days are lengthening, and the wind, though chill, has lost its teeth. I dread the coming of summer, with its endless afternoons and interminable evenings, when I will be plagued with visitors, all of them with urgent and vital business, from sunup until sundown. I am wrung by anxiety, even though it is still weeks until the official opening of the roads. Two days ago, a premature thaw erupted unexpectedly, causing the ice on the lake to crack and sing, and having a similar effect on the children and their tutors. More and more I find myself retreating to this inner sanctum and ignoring knocks and calls from the other side of the door, only to stare across the lake at that pile of boulders, that look like the remains of an abandoned fortress, its wall breached, its inhabitants slaughtered... unthinkable ages ago. But yesterday the warmth went out of the air like a quenched fire, and last night it was bitterly cold. Today, as if in answer to my prayers, it began to snow. There was little wind, and fat flakes were sticking to whatever they touched first, piling up two fingerbreadths on even the slenderest twigs. Too warm, I was thinking, too wet. Cannot last. At least the clouds were low, drifting heavily near the surface of the lake, almost obscuring the view of the cliff face opposite. Early sunset tonight, I murmured to myself. If I can just stay awake until evening meal... My eyes were half closed when I heard footfalls on the porch outside my windows. A man stood gazing out over the lake, his shoulders and hood thick with snow. Oh no, I thought. Not now, not today. I looked more closely at the man, hoping it was one of the teachers out for a walk. His shape was unknown to me, but there was something familiar about the way he stood. The man then pulled back his hood. It was Robenc. I could not have known, my son, what was about to happen, but the instant I recognized him I was seized with fear, not of this man, but for him. He was more mature, of course: there was some gray in his hair and beard, his face had lines around the eyes, and he had taken on weight. But it was the same proud man who years ago had served a sentence of humiliation here. I realize as I write that if you are reading this now, you may know better than I, who can only imagine it, what fate this courageous man has met. Well, I leave it to you to complete the tale. There cannot be much time left for me in any case, especially if it is ever learned that he came to me. I pushed open my casement and invited him to come in through the refectory door. I then fussed over him for several moments, preparing bark tea for both of us and brushing the snow off his cloak as he warmed himself before the fire. 'This is an unexpected honor, Phylax &mdash; I should say, Praetor Robenc. I must confess to being more than a little surprised by your appearance at our rustic retreat.' He smiled his beautiful smile. 'Yes, Abbas,' &mdash; he used the familiar term &mdash; 'I never expected to return.' 'Your stay with us was so unpleasant?' 'You know what it was, Abbas. You yourself were banished here before me.' 'Ah, but my productive life was behind me then. Yours had barely started.' 'And having paid my debt, I am meaningfully placed in my lord's service.' 'Where you thrive?' 'Where I thrive.' He seemed reluctant to go on, and I was unsure where in this conversation the traps might be. After a moment I said, 'Can I get you another glass of tea?' 'No, thank you. I see you are perplexed. I fear that I myself am out of my depth.' Once again he hesitated. 'You wish to ask advice of me?' He sighed. 'I need counsel, Abbas.' A long silence followed, while he stared at the floor without moving. At last he took in a deep breath, drained his glass, and walked over to the windows. 'How long have those rocks been there, do you think?' I hardly knew what to say. 'As long as I can remember,' I joked, but he did not even smile. 'Why do they look like that,' he said, 'as if the ground of the world had given way?' 'Perhaps that is what happened.' There may have been something in the way I said it that made him turn and stare at me. 'I'm afraid I cannot advise you on that subject,' I said, joining him at the window. 'I am not quite old enough.' The man's seriousness was beginning to unnerve me. He turned back to gaze out the window. 'I have become entangled in a business I do not understand. A short while ago my lord the Golias asked that I locate a friend whom he had not seen since they were boys together. He said he had merely thought of this friend one day for no particular reason, but had been unable to contact him by the usual means. He spoke in a lighthearted fashion, and stressed that he was asking for a favor, not an official investigation. It would not be necessary to involve anyone else, he said.' He fell silent. 'You were suspicious.' 'Not &mdash; well, yes. My lord the Golias is a fiercely intelligent man, and he pursues projects that I am not required to know about. What surprised me was that he explicitly told me not to involve anyone else. I never would have done that without asking his permission first.' 'You were surprised that he knew you so little.' 'I was surprised because he knew that perfectly well, and still thought it necessary to tell me. It made me begin to think either that he had stopped trusting me or else there was a secret message in this unusual request. If there is a hidden meaning, I have not deciphered it.' I kept silent, waiting until I had heard the rest of his tale. 'I proceeded cautiously. I did not entirely believe that the Golias had just thought of this old friend without cause. My first guess was he had heard somehow that his friend was in the city, but he could not, for a reason that was immediately obvious, go searching for the man himself: this Historian was either associated with known enemies of the realm, or was in some sort of trouble that the Golias could not be seen getting him out of. If the first were the case, the Golias would not need an investigator, he would have sent someone better skilled in diplomacy than myself. So it seemed likely that I was chosen as a ferret. And ferret I did. Of course, I was almost certain from the start where my search would lead me.' 'The Office of Inquiry?' 'Where else could a person disappear so completely? It is a world unto itself; no one goes there willingly, and those who are taken there against their will never come back out. As a matter of course I twice attempted to send agents to penetrate that deep secrecy, but once inside those walls they themselves fell silent, and I could hardly request of the Chief Inquirer that he let me have them back.' 'So what did you do?' I asked; I could barely breathe. 'I went there myself, openly, and simply demanded of the gatekeeper that I be permitted to visit the prisoner &mdash; they call them clients, I understand. The poor man was completely overborne by my title and my decorations, and after fuddling with some papers in his little kiosk, sent me with a runner boy to the Office of the Prior.' 'The Good Doctor,' I said, my heart sinking. 'The very same. He naturally denied knowing anything about this Historian, but his secretary &mdash; ' 'Not little Egderus?' 'Yes. He gave me a sign as the Good Doctor was showing me out that made me think I had not come in vain. Later I was able to confirm that the Historian was indeed a client of the Office of Inquiry, and that the Good Doctor was attending to him personally.' I must have groaned involuntarily, for he added quickly, 'This was not the worst news I could have received &mdash; at least the man is still alive, or was when I left the city. Now you must help me, abbas. You know the Good Doctor, you must know something about the Office of Inquiry. How do I rescue this man?'

	["Testimony of Praetor Aric","My first post was at Mountain House, where I served as stratiotés under Phylax Gig and then Phylax Robenc. When Robenc became Praetor of the Guard here, he made me his adjutant. I was off duty at the time, but Praetor Robenc sent word for me to join him at the home of a private citizen. I was not informed of the citizen's identity, only the location of his residence. No, it was not a direct order. A runner dispatched to me by the Praetor. No, no written order would have been prepared or carried. No, I do not recall who delivered the message. The message said I was to join the Praetor at the place he specified. No, I do not recall the exact words of the message. I cannot tell you what was in the runner's mind, sir. I assumed nothing, sir. I dressed for duty and went to join the Praetor. No, sir. I knew how to find the place, but had never been there before. Not at the time, no: I saw no reason to anticipate danger. When I arrived at the citizen's residence, I heard a violent disturbance inside. At the same moment I heard men shouting and running toward me up the side street. I did not know what to expect, so I drew my weapon and prepared to defend myself. It is what we are trained for, sir. First, last, always: do what is necessary to stay alive. A squad of six men came around the corner with their weapons drawn. Their leader pointed at me and charged. I defended myself. I did not see his face, sir, only the weapon pointed at me. When he fell, his helmet came off, and I recognized the Centurion. No, sir. His head remained attached to his neck. Yes, sir. He was dead. Yes, sir, as you say. The other men stopped dead themselves. I believe they recognized me. I was not wearing my helmet. I was wearing my forage cap, sir. There was no time, sir. The disturbance inside the house was still going on. I recognized the Praetor's voice. No, not his voice alone. But we could not tell how many others were involved. His voice was raised as if in battle. The sound is unmistakable, sir. The door was locked, sir. We were required to break through it. Praetor Robenc and another man were struggling in the front room. The man was attacking Praetor Robenc with a knife. Praetor Robenc was unarmed, but was holding the man off as best he could. At the moment we broke in, he had the man by the throat. I ordered the men to part them as quickly as possible. I then had the citizen taken to a separate room, while I stayed in the front and tried to ascertain from Praetor Robenc how the disturbance came about. It was difficult, sir. Praetor Robenc was nearly berserk, and very hard to restrain. The citizen was shrieking, evidently in terror. Neither could be calmed. The citizen apparently said something about an attempt to assassinate the Golias. No, sir. I was with Praetor Robenc at the time, and did not hear exactly what the citizen said. The soldier who reported it to me was himself uncertain what the man meant. Many things were possible, sir. At the time I thought it best to go to the Palace myself in order to warn the Golias if necessary, or to be of assistance in the event that an attack was in progress. As I said, many things were possible. I used my best judgment. No man could be spared in restraining Praetor Robenc and the other man, and -- I didn't think the word of any of the other men would be taken seriously. Because they were not officers. Yes, sir. That was my reason. I have no knowledge of a rivalry between Praetor Robenc and the Centurion. As you say, sir. Not my business to know. I am not familiar with that name, sir. I had heard of an official who was known as the Good Doctor. Before I left, I ordered both men arrested for breach of the peace. Praetor Robenc was to be kept under guard at his quarters. The other man was taken to the Keep. When I arrived at the Palace, I went immediately to speak to the Golias. Yes, sir. The guards know me, sir. The Golias sent a platoon to confirm that custody of Praetor Robenc and the other man had been secured. Then he questioned me for about an hour. I cannot say, sir. I answered his questions as best I could, but I know little of what was in his mind. Yes, sir. I am acquainted with the name Egderus. We occupied adjacent beds in the infirmary for a few days. He had been injured in a fall. I was recovering from a chill. We spoke of this and that. There was not much to say between us. Yes, sir, we had seen each other before. At Mountain House, where I was stationed before my posting here. He had been a resident in the main house. As I say, we had seen each other before. We had never spoken. The brothers in the house had their affairs, and we in the garrison had ours. Our paths rarely crossed. Yes, sir, he did say that he worked as a scriptor in the Office of Inquiry. He did not disclose the name of his superior. It's no secret what kind of work is done in the Office of Inquiry. I have no opinion on that, sir. My duties are enough to keep my mind busy. One night, when the fever was upon me, I thought I heard the young man talking in his sleep. He seemed to be dreaming that he was being tortured, or perhaps just threatened. He kept shouting, 'No! No! don't do that!' Then he screamed. The matron had to come and give him a potion to make him sleep quietly. The next morning he apologized for keeping me awake. I said I had heard nothing, but he then burst out with a long lament about his beloved. He went on and on about how beautiful and good this person was, and how heartsick it made him that they could not be together. He called him My Historian. He did not mention a name. Calf love, sir. It's not uncommon -- the roughest recruits are not immune to it. But this was a dreamy lad, in love with being in love, if you understand me. You can tell the difference. Real love is quiet, sir. You don't need to tell everyone about it. Yes, sir, I've known it. And the loss of it. And it didn't kill me, the way this silly boy said it was killing him. No, sir. That just fuels the fire.","TestimonyofPraetorAric.html"],

But Suzu remembered that her father had always been loving and kind, so she wondered if there might be another reason, and she resolved to find that reason out. When she was old enough, Suzu went to the university, where she studied philosophy. To see Suzu was to fall in love with her, and she in turn fell in love with others. But love did not last, often turning to bitterness before the end, and philosophy, though it engaged her mind, left her heart unmoved, and so did not satisfy her longing to understand. The question that haunted her &mdash; Why did my father abandon us? &mdash; could not be answered by either philosophy or love. One day Suzu found an old book which told the story of a boy who leaves home and has a great adventure. She wondered if her father might have left his home in order to have a great adventure. She thought it might prove a great adventure for her to go out in search of her father, and decided to leave her comfortable world behind and strike out on her own.

Of course this transmigration does take place, in a way, but what lives on is our ghost, in however many instances we've managed to implant &mdash; each slightly (or greatly) different from every other, like handwritten copies of a text &mdash; and each mortal: when the last host of our ghost passes out of existence, we too are gone. Think of Ozymandias. [The reference is unknown &mdash; Ed.] There were those among us, and ourselves from time to time, who believed in real ghosts (whatever that could possibly mean): immaterial forms of ourselves &mdash; if that's not a contradiction in terms &mdash; which we often pictured as hanging around in the living world on account of some residue of strong emotion, like longing, remorse, or vengeful rage. I don't know what ghost of me this Boy will carry with him when he leaves what's left of me behind; he can't remember much of the world we shared unawares before we met in this terrible afterlife; certainly he had a mother, likely a father, even brothers and sisters... &mdash; do you have friends when you're however old he is? &mdash; so, perhaps friends. All of them ghosts now. All the world a swirling cloud of ghosts. No. That's what the world was. Before whatever hit us hit us. Now the world is cleansed &mdash; well, except for the two little ghosts living in this ruin along with the Boy and me: my ghost and his ghost. When he goes out in the morning, he leaves his ghost behind for me to talk to; whether my ghost goes with him or not he doesn't say. Well, we can't keep track of the ghosts: not our job. Not any more. But once upon a time, it was all we did, or tried to. =====[lacuna]=====   Mourning. Once you begin, it never ends, but you go on living with it, in spite of it &mdash; maybe in mere spite: a perfectly sound reason to go on living, I've found. You get something when you lose something, even if it's only confirmation that life's a bitch. [The idiom is obscure &mdash; Ed.] Something to go on. So: going on. Looks like a beautiful day towards, as they used to say it. Cold, but bright. Boy's still asleep, but as soon as the light touches his little corner, he'll get up and set off. Sometimes he's away all day, only appears when the sun's already down, but the sky's still light enough to see his way back. I love to think of him tromping through the woods, exploring. A stick in his hand, whacking tree trunks with it. He'll take his sling, of course &mdash; he brought home a rabbit last evening, very proud of himself, as he should be. Yes, we had a regular banquet &mdash; it's why he's sleeping late. See? after all that I've lost, that he's lost, all that's gone forever, we go on. We even took time for a little blessing over the rabbit, to give thanks to its ghost for the meat for our supper. Today, life looks good. So while I'm in a mellow mood, I'm going to try to puzzle out something that's been gnawing at me for days. Not much else to do but think, now I can't get around. Meat. What's left behind when you take out the ghost. What the ghosts use (or used to use) to talk to each other>. Face to face, you can always tell what people are saying, if you're willing to listen to the music of their voice, to mark the light in their eyes (or lack of it), the way they sit, shift their weight, gesture with their hands and head. You're too good at reading faces (the first thing you ever saw was a face) to be fooled by the words coming out of it. Sometimes, when you're not hearing or seeing what you want to hear or see, you pretend that you are, just to be agreeable, or to ward off a scene. Most of the time what's being said doesn't matter enough to make a scene about, because most of the time whatever you're saying or hearing is just music, just to pass the time, like your cat walking into the room and yelling at you because she feels like a little conversation before her next nap. Then there's text... =====[lacuna?]=====   Plenty of theories about where text came from, when it first appeared &mdash; but those theories are all texts, so they can't be true in any everlasting sense &mdash; nothing is true anywhere or ever but here and now, and text only exists elsewhere and elsewhen, or else it couldn't fulfill its ghostly mission &mdash; anyway, how do you prove a theory's true? You can demonstrate the likelihood that this or that happened, but the demonstration would just be another damn text. The evidence doesn't lie, we've been told, but that's only because the evidence doesn't say anything. It just lies there, like the dead body on the floor; it can't speak any more than that dead body can, because the ghost has absconded. Facts never speak for themselves; we make them speak; we make them: that's what 'fact' means &mdash; something made. What we speak, when we're ventriloquizing like that, is text. The Boy does the same, when he's talking to himself &mdash; in whatever tongue he speaks &mdash; taking the voice of each of his associates in turn: the bird on the branch, the bunny in the brush, the stick in his hand, the stone in the sling. They speak through him, they tell him their tales, their worries, their woes, and he tells them his. Or so I imagine he does when he's out of my hearing, since he makes not a sound when we're together. Well, except in his sleep, and what he says then has no words. But it does have music, and I listen with the deepest attention when he sings or cries out or babbles at length in his dream language. If he listens to me in like wise, when he's awake and I'm not, I don't know. But I was talking about text. There's meat text and ghost text, just like we who make text are ourselves made of meat and ghost. And, just like us, as soon as text is created (I will not say born), it starts to change &mdash; to grow, to gain strength, to send out its tentacles, to reproduce, also to decline and die. The meat part cannot lie; it's the ghosts do that &mdash; and they are lying all the time; they lie in what they speak, they lie in what they understand. They never say anything straight; they're always listening to something else. But what do we expect? You want a straight answer? go straight to the meat. That's what it's for. It can't go far; it can't go anywhere, in fact: for the meat, there is no where but here, no when but now, and now, and now. To the meat, here isn't a word, a text. Now isn't a word. Meat is all there is, really. What I've just said is, of course, a text. It has a meat part and a ghost part. The meat part will go with me &mdash; or, I should say, stay. The ghost part is already off on its own, headed for god knows where, for god knows how long, scattering its bastards throughout the five kingdoms...

	["The Kinds of Wildernesses","Now it is said that wildernesses are of five kinds: robber wildernesses, wild-beast wildernesses, drought wildernesses, famine wildernesses, and demon wildernesses. The first wilderness is when the way is beset by robbers; to defend against robbers, you must hire soldiers or other men with weapons to protect you from them, should they fall upon you. A show of force may discourage a small band of highwaymen; but if the robbers be desperate, they may attack you in order to save themselves from perishing in the wilderness. Or they may be so successful at their profession that they fear no one. The only protection against such robbers is to carry nothing worth taking the trouble to steal. This, of course, is not always possible &mdash; for example, when fleeing for refuge to another land; in this case, it is necessary to conceal or disguise the treasure that must be conveyed through the wilderness so that the robbers will believe you bear nothing of worth. The second wilderness is when the region is afflicted by lions or wolves or other wild beasts; to defend against these, a troop of soldiers is best, but most wild beasts can be kept off by fire, which will need to be tended with care and vigilance. It must be remembered, however, that although beasts avoid fire, men are attracted to it. The third wilderness is when there is no water to be got, for drinking or for bathing; no other remedy avails but to bear drinking water with you, and to hire a guide who knows where oases are located and the path to follow to get to them. Bathing may need to be forgone until the journey's end. The fourth wilderness is when no roots or other food are to be found; as with water, you must bear victuals along with you, which may be dried, or salted, or smoked beforehand, in order not to spoil. Or you may hunt, if you are able, and there is game to be found. And the fifth wilderness is when the road is beset by demons. Demons are harmful beings from the spirit world that are full of rage and hatred towards us and are bent on our destruction. They are very powerful, and ordinary means are insufficient to defend against them. Some say that demons are unable to kill outright, and must rely on human agents to carry out this ultimate of evil intents. Not everyone believes this; as the Remnant say, it is better to be proved a credulous fool than to scoff and then be shown your mistake. And for some, death may be preferable to the torment that demons are capable of inflicting upon them. Now demons are of five kinds: violence demons, madness demons, temptation demons, mirage demons, and argument demons. Violence demons attack the body, madness demons attack the mind, temptation demons attack the desires, mirage demons attack the senses, and argument demons attack the understanding. The first four kinds of demons may be warded off with magic garments, talismans, spells, and the like; if obtainable, such safeguards may be hired or bought outright, and sometimes, for a considerable fee, a magician may be persuaded to join the company on the journey through a demon wilderness. The fifth kind of demon, the argument demon, will never attack a group, since its only business is with the lone seeker. Indeed, it is said that a seeker cannot complete his quest until he meets his demon and conquers it. The argument demon, as has been said, attacks the understanding &mdash; that is, the sense a person has of how life works. If, for example, one believes that this world is a place where justice prevails, then the argument demon may confront him with images or stories of the death of children, the suffering of the blameless poor, the triumph of iniquitous men. In this way the argument demon lures its victim into debate, from which the demon draws energy, while the seeker strength is exhausted. Although it is possible to steel oneself against such an encounter beforehand, once the argument demon is engaged, no other person or object will be of any help. And the outcome is determined as with every other fight to the death: one is stronger, or possesses superior weapons, or more endurance, or better luck, and prevails; the other is destroyed, and is never seen again. The story is told that a company traveling through the wilderness was attacked first by robbers, who made away with all their provisions, and then by wild beasts, who ripped to pieces all but one of the members of the party. This person could only stay alive in the wilderness by feeding off what the wild beasts left behind, beset the whole time by madness demons which took the form of the spirits of those who had been slaughtered. When at last this lone survivor was rescued by another company of travelers, he showed them scraps of dried skin and splintered bone with strange markings upon them, saying that they contained the voices of his companions. When asked how this could be, he took up one of the scraps, and, gazing at its markings intently, began to speak in a different voice, telling the story of the person to whom that remainder of flesh had once belonged. Many in the company were revolted by this recital, and demanded that the poor lunatic be put out of his agony at once. But others felt a weird reverence for the man and for the objects he had preserved out of his appalling ordeal. They questioned him further, and he taught them how he had captured his lost companions' voices by transferring their utterance from his memory to the inscriptions on the remnants of their presence. And his rescuers in turn taught others this magical practice as they continued on their journey, and in this way it spread throughout the world. In doing so, some say, they created a new wilderness, the wilderness of text. Once entered, the wilderness of text permits no return.","TheKindsofWildernesses.html"],

Few come here; fewer still return to the land where all men are. Once brought here, one understands why. In the land where all men are, it is nearly impossible to conceive that there even is such a place as the land where no man is, let alone find it. Nearly. And nearly is near enough for most, for they have other things to do &mdash; for other men, to other men, with other men, in the world they have builded together. Of the very very few for whom the word 'impossible' is not a comfort but a summons, very very few ever find the land where no man is, for they do not know how to look for such a place: all their maps and their diagrams, their tools and their engines, their lessons and their practices, were devised to be deployed in the land where all men are, and none are any use in the land where no man is. There is no Teacher here, no Teaching to be brought back from here. This is not the wilderness, in its many kinds, of which the world is but one. To seek this place, one must set off in the opposite direction from all worlds. To approach the land where no man is, one must abandon every thing in the world, and this cannot be done without violence. It is also impossible to do without nearly impossible providence, such as being the only survivor of a holocaust of one's own igniting.","TheLandWhereNoManIs.html"],

	["The Locust Grove","We were lolling in the grove of honey locusts that stand on the terrace just outside the main hall, above the esplanade at the water's edge. It was hot, and we were sweating in our regalia &mdash; the closing ceremonies of the Convention were to begin in an hour's time &mdash; and we'd taken wine at luncheon, during which some venerable luminary had been lauded for a lifetime's contribution to the community. I was sitting on a bench, my back against one of the graceful trees that shaded us from the blazing sun, enveloping us in the golden glow of their just yellowing leaves. The tower bell tolled in pairs, blessing the lazy murmur of desultory discourse, attended by the gardeners laboring invisibly nearby, waiting for us to move, and the bees that worked the sea-roses in their beds beside the cove. There was a remarkably high chop, and the pleasure craft tied up there strained at their moorings, thumping against the pier posts and each other in a vaguely annoying way. Otherwise, all was well, all was very well, and the tranquility of the scene was enlivened by the bouncing bosoms of young women taking exercise along the esplanade, a pleasant spectacle that we scholars affected to eye with disdain, while the gardeners' young assistants gazed at them with frank admiration and desire. Two of us were discussing the life shared by those august persons who had occupied the dais at the luncheon we were at present digesting &mdash; figures from all over the world whose accomplishment had earned them the right to move confidently among the highest levels of society. One of my colleagues, reflecting the clear expectation we all had that we would follow these important people into a life of attainment, wondered if they might feel more at ease in each other's company than they would with folk from their place of origin, even their own families. The other said this was certainly true, and proposed that this commonality might even extend to their sense of possibility, of knowing with assurance what could be changed or created in this world, and of themselves as possessors of the knowledge, skills, and power to make it so. We fell silent, nodding &mdash; what more need be said? A breeze passed politely through the grove, cooling my forehead; a robin warbled sweetly in the branches high above the grove. An odd phrase drifted through my mind: my fugitive peace. Just then a disturbance erupted near the side door where the workmen and servants came and went: a man in scholar's garb, ill-fitting and faded, staggered out into the plaza. After righting himself, he began to move towards us with the overcareful precision of a person who's had too much to drink, trying with difficulty to keep his eyes focused on the path. Suddenly he began to shake, and stumbled down the steps to the railing, where he vomited copiously into the pristine blue water. It was shock as much as anything, I believe, that made us laugh at the drunken man, but our amusement turned to disgust as he roared again and again, bending strenuously over the rail with each heave, until long past the point where there was anything more to bring forth. All the charming music of the moment before had ceased &mdash; except for the thudding of the boats &mdash; and every scholar, resident, servant, and wild creature in the cove stared at the man as he eventually straightened up and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. He turned and attempted to smooth his tunic, which only made worse the slashing stain down its front. Then he raised his eyes and met mine. We were no more than a few paces apart, and the look on his face has haunted me my whole life. I saw him see me, and know me, and somehow try to tell me with those baleful eyes that what had happened to him could happen to me, that the worst thing I could ever imagine was ever waiting, always able to come to pass, and that there is nothing whatever in this magnificent world that can protect anyone from that. He regarded each of the rest briefly, then took in a sharp breath through his nose and strode straight through our little group, scattering those in his path, making for the main gate, through which he then passed without hesitating and was gone. Immediately my colleagues began to cluck and comment excitedly. One recognized him from a pre-convention workshop some days before, something about an archive of ancient writings that he had discovered in a backwater House upriver somewhere. Another had heard an administrator remark that the Council would make short work of the 'country cousin with the archive' &mdash; obviously an upstart trying to push his way in among his betters by passing off forged documents as a major find in his province. During the interminable speeches and ceremonies of self-congratulation that followed, I idly wondered how such a pageant would appeal to the poor inebriate we had seen in the locust grove. If any of the gossip about him was true, he might have deserved whatever punishment he received; but I mused that deserving my punishment has never made it any easier to take, and, were I in his place, I most certainly would seize my first opportunity to get so crapulent I puked my insides out all over the authorities' pretty little cove. Before this, it would never have occurred to me that said authorities could be totally in the wrong, but the aftermath of the wine, the stifling heat of the auditorium, and the pompous thunderings of the speakers' perorations had cast me into a misanthropic mood, and for the first time I began to reflect rather darkly upon the enterprise to which my guardians had engaged me.","TheLocustGrove.html"],

I mean the World of Text.

And text, as we know, is a perpetration &mdash; our experience of life rolled up & jammed into little suitcases made of words so they can be transported away from us poor gobbets of meat stuck forever in the Here&Now, without our permission, to anywhere the ghosts need them to be, for purposes beyond our ken. Worse, our guardians contaminate us with their ghosts from the moment we're born, setting up a chatter that never ceases, so that by the time we learn to talk ourselves we're making up our own ghosts, and end up believing our whole lives long that what the ghosts say is what we are, that what they make us do is our own idea &mdash; until it's impossible to even *see* that what the ghosts want could possibly be different from what we want, or that it could be bad for us to go along with their nefarious plots. And it is bad for us, and for everything we come in contact with, which we have to rip out & dig up & kill off & move somewhere else to make room for what the ghosts call Our (meaning Their) Magnificent Creations, which are in truth monstrosities of ruination &mdash; huge, hideous, dead constructions in which the only life forms left (us) scurry to & fro in the blinding light, bearing more 'creations' for the ghosts from one place to another, & generating more and more text, whose artifacts spawn like pond scum throughout the whole system, piling up to fill every erstwhile empty scintilla of space. Well, not any more. The ghosts overwhelmed us, the so-called 'system' went chaotic, and then the whole world &mdash; text, meat, ghosts, everything &mdash; just... blew up. What was lost when the ghosts got their way and destroyed everything? Nothing of value, as far as I can tell. I'm living in the smoking crater of their senseless self-immolation along with that brave, beat-up but unbroken little boy, who knows better than to speak to me, keeping his ghosts to himself if he has any. And so far, I miss nothing of that Perpetrated World, and feel nothing but relief that it's gone. That boy's silent company is more consolation to me than a million million texts could ever ever be. And our brief friendship has given me the courage and the cussedness to keep fighting off what's left of my ghosts until I am at last brought down by the noble failure of the meat. Point is, nothing important happened, when whatever hit us hit us. I don't know what it was, and I find I don't care what it was. Suddenly one day nothing worked, and then everyone else disappeared. For a short while, it was a scramble to figure out how to manage, but that turned out to be no different from the way it was before, except that I no longer had to consult the ghosts, who were always squabbling with each other about what to do next!

	["The Retreat House","I came here again tonight. I cannot seem to leave the place alone. We used to return here often: it was where we met, after all, or so my beloved told me. However, I was not thinking of my dearest friend from so long ago, as I prowled the ruins of the Temple precincts, searching out a place of shelter for the night, and at last came upon what had once been the Locust Grove. Instead I was remembering that soused hayseed, in his borrowed (or stolen) scholar's gear, whom I never saw again. No one found out what became of him, in the end, though for a while the rumors snaked and drifted among us, for it was a curious affair: Censure and Confiscation had not been imposed for many years, and it was hard not to wonder if the 'treasure' this 'scholar' brought to the Convention was deemed by the Council to be too important for a nobody like him to be permitted to bungle. A couple of my colleagues began to muse ominously about a plot to trammel free inquiry; wisely, we avoided them, and before long one of them recanted, calling the whole thing a silly hoax. The other just disappeared, perhaps in order to pursue the matter independently, or... maybe he was persuaded to leave us in some other way. Meanwhile, our work continued, and prospered, and before we knew it we were out in the world, some as teachers and treatise-writers, some as minor officials and even advisors to persons of power. I found myself having business with one or another of my former comrades nearly every day, as we carried out missions for our new employers, who of course all knew each other from the days of their own youth, when they first took up their work &mdash; and their grown-up lives &mdash; in the school of the Temple. It all turned out exactly as we dreamed it would that day when we drowsed in the shade of the Locust Grove, before that horrid man appeared. Indeed, after a time I no longer remembered the incident, though for some reason the sour feeling I experienced afterwards returned more and more often, until at last it began to affect my work. My employer, a kind man, who loved me, offered to send me on retreat to a House in the mountains upriver, assuring me that my place in his household would await my return, no matter how long I needed to stay away. And so ended my idyll among the blessed of this world. For at that isolated refuge, where we fasted, and sat for hours in the cold meditation hall, reading nothing, writing nothing, keeping perfect silence except to chant the ancient prayers and hymns, I fell in love, and whatever happiness I had been convinced was my destiny abandoned me forever. My beloved, the House Master's assistant, seemed to recognize me from the first. I did not recollect it, but he said that we had spoken more than once at the Temple in the city. We had met, as he recalled with perfect clarity, in the Locust Grove, during his last year as a scholar. At the time, he said, I was too young to appeal to him, but for some reason I had never gone far from his thoughts, even after all these years. Did I mention that my friend was a poet? His employer had sent him to the Retreat House, he told me &mdash; this as we lay in his bed that first night &mdash; because he too seemed unhappy, for a reason he could not express, and could not discover its source. He sat for many months in meditation, trying to clear his mind and perceive the world for what it is &mdash; empty of any meaning but itself &mdash; when one day, during the morning session, the Master of the House, a severe man with a violent temper, struck him on the head with his baton and told him to stop smiling. At that moment my friend was awakened, he said, and from then on the Master began to groom him to be his successor as head of the Retreat House. In those days it was not unusual for the Master to have a wife, and this Master's wife was herself in love with my friend, or at least wished to possess him, as she had done with many others. This woman convinced the Master that we were corrupting others with our debauchery, and my friend was expelled from the community. I was placed in confinement to contemplate my sins, but instead I raged and howled against the injustice of my friend's expulsion, denouncing the degenerate behavior of the Master's wife; eventually all restraint abandoned me and I wrecked the room in which I was imprisoned. At last the Master was persuaded to have me stripped and whipped and driven into the wilderness outside the Retreat House enclosure. Some demon must have taken hold of me then. The public beating I endured was humiliating, but I could tell that the Master was not eager to punish me so severely: perhaps he was himself ashamed for being unable to resist his wife's debased commands. As for me, every stroke seemed to fire some terrible inner strength, and by the time the flogging was over, and I was dragged out of the gates, I already knew how my revenge would be accomplished. 'I may have made the mistake of love,' I said to myself as I was dumped by the side of the road, 'but the Master's wife shall not remain in the Retreat House either, if my friend is to be treated so unjustly.' It was still the custom to have a small garrison nearby the more remote Houses, by that time more to ward off the odd marauding bear than to protect them from armed human enemies, and I went there in my nakedness, saying I'd been attacked by bandits, and asked to be sheltered for the night. One of the soldiers seemed to recognize me from the House, but I begged him with my eyes not to let on, and in his returning look I could see that he would go along with the deception, at least for the moment. This man took charge of tending me; he bathed and bound my wounds with an expert gentleness that bespoke a kindly heart &mdash; so I thought at first &mdash; all the while murmuring to me in a soothing voice, asking no questions, but gradually helping me to understand that he knew precisely what had happened to me, and at whose hands, and that he could guess with some confidence what I had done to bring such treatment upon me. In short, he let me know that he would exact some recompense for his conspiring with me to hide the truth. I was fed and given a spare uniform to wear; he told me it belonged to a younger comrade who abandoned his post and never returned. As I looked into his eyes, I saw that in this matter as well, he knew entirely what had happened to his missing friend. By then it was dark, and the men began to drink. I had seen from the first that the old sergeant was a rumpot, and it turned out that he and the only other soldier at the post were long-time confrères in this nightly ritual. They invited me to join them, saying it would do me good, and I saw my plan ripening more quickly than I could have imagined. Except for my 'nurse'. I had a good idea what would be entailed in my repaying his kindness, or at least how it would begin, and, since there was no avoiding it, I let him know by my expression that I was prepared to do whatever he asked of me, whenever he wished. He told his companions that he would take the first watch, an idea that struck them as excellent and worthy of the gentleman and scholar they had long known him secretly to be, and they set to their work with a will, whilst my caretaker collected his gear and went up the ladder to the watchtower. Within a short time they were nodding on their benches, and I was able to bid them good night, having barely sipped at the foul but potent brew that apparently was nectar to them, at least after the first potful. I stood to take my leave, and turned to find myself face to face with my guardian, who led me not into the small dormitory, where he had first laid me carefully on one of the four cots in order to see to my injuries, but up to the tower, where, in contrast to the tender concern with which he had put his hands on every part of my body just a few hours before, he seized and raped me with such suddenness and power that I had not even the breath to cry out. Afterwards he struck me hard across the face, then levelled a warning finger an inch from my eyes &mdash; no need for words to tell what lay in store, if I so much as thought about betraying him. I suppose he might have murdered me there and then, and I saw him consider it. Had he done so when he had the chance, he could have made me disappear as he had done with his young comrade, and many lives would have been spared. Instead he raped me again, though this time with less violence, as if endeavoring to bring me to some pleasure as well. Or perhaps he was just measuring out more carefully what potency he had left: he was no longer a young man. I could only submit, as before, and when he was finished I leaned upon him as though succumbing against my will. But I knew our final reckoning would not take long to arrive. He pushed me away, and sank back onto the bench that ran along the wall behind him. I shivered and whimpered on the floor, but watched him closely all the while, considering my options. When he at last raised his eyes to look at me they were filled with such hatred and disgust I was certain that my time to die had come. He lurched toward me, and I backed away as best I could, but soon was hemmed against the opposite wall, where I cowered, my arms before my face. But he did not attack me. Instead he fell on his knees and embraced my feet, weeping and begging me to forgive him. I snatched my feet out of his grasp, and scurried into the nearest corner, but he did not pursue me: he simply collapsed on the floor in the center of the room, sobbing and blubbering about how my exquisite beauty had inflamed him, he couldn't help himself, he was mortified by his actions, and so on. His behavior was so astonishing that I could hardly understand the words he said, and this made me hesitate to seize the nearest heavy object and smash his head with it, as I should have done. I did, however, manage to pull a stool from under the small desk nearby and put it between us, so that I could, in theory, ward him off with it if he came at me again. But he did not, and after a while he sat back on the floor; we stared at each other through the legs of the stool, as if through the bars of a cell. Which of us was the prisoner, and which the keeper, however, at that moment teetered in the balance. At last he heaved a great sigh, then cleared his throat, as if about to make a speech. 'My fate is in your hands,' he said, unbuckling his weapon, and sliding it over to me on the floor. 'I have disgraced myself, I have violated you, and I cannot hope to be forgiven. I would be grateful if you would end my life, but, if that is not sufficient reparation, I bow my head to whatever punishment you care to impose.' I spoke before I knew it. 'Burn down the Retreat House.'   It did not take long. With the garrison's key he opened the gates; he then smashed a keg of lamp oil against the front door of the House, and set it on fire with his torch. We fled into the forest, and climbed to the top of the other side of the chasm that half-surrounds the Retreat House like a moat. From there we watched the ancient building burn to the ground, taking with it the barn, the granary, and the meditation hall. The alarm sounded, and we heard screams and the bellows animals, but saw no one escape. A floating cinder touched off the thatched roof of the tiny garrison's watchtower, and it too was enveloped in flames immediately. Neither the sergeant nor his boon companion emerged. No survivors: we destroyed every living being that entrusted its life to the protection of that House.   Sometime before dawn I wrenched my eyes from the blazing wreckage and saw a queer look on my accomplice's face: his lips were drawn back, his eyes fixed on the flames, bright as any stars; he pulled in a prodigious breath through his nose, then gave out a long howl of unmistakable triumph. We were sitting near the edge of a precipice. As carefully as I could, so as not to disturb his moment of transport, I shifted so that my legs were behind him, and then, planting both feet in the middle of his back, I shoved with all the power I could gather, propelling him into empty space. As he fell, he reached back and caught hold of the sleeve of the young soldier's light blouse I was wearing, and for a few hideous moments I felt myself sliding toward the edge, but then the seam split and the sleeve pulled loose, and my rapist disappeared into the abyss without a sound.   The first thing I saw when I came to myself was my beloved's face peering earnestly into mine, as if trying to pour all his abundant strength into me. I learned that I lay in the infirmary of the Scholars' Residence at the Temple, where later I would be attended by an unsmiling nurse in stiff white linen and visited occasionally by the physician I remembered as an instructor in medicine at the school. My friend told me that, after his banishment from the Retreat House, he had returned to the city and told his employer of the treachery of the Master's wife; his employer himself set off at once to confront the Master about this flagrant injustice. And so it was that the destruction of the Retreat House was discovered. My friend's employer set an inquiry in motion, which determined that it must have been an awful accident, from which I alone had escaped, so traumatized by the catastrophe that I could remember nothing of how it came to pass. My beloved himself discovered me lying in the Locust Grove, nearly dead from exposure &mdash; how I had made my way there must remain a mystery, for even today I have no memory of descending the mountain and entering the city, let alone how I passed through the locked Temple gates in order to finally collapse in just the place where my lover would find me. Poor innocent! He did not inspect my injuries, or did not know how to interpret them &mdash; he only understood that I was badly hurt and needed his help. To the physician and the nurse in the infirmary, however, it was obvious that I had been whipped and violated, and from their mild but repeated questions I inferred that they were not completely convinced that I remembered nothing. My nurse in particular sensed that some evil still clung to me. One day I opened my eyes to find her gazing at me thoughtfully, as if gauging me somehow; her lips were slightly parted, and she was taking in a deep breath through her nose... just like that man. The one I murdered. When she saw me looking at her, her countenance changed instantly to its accustomed mien of professional concern, but a curious light still gleamed a moment longer in her eyes. I feel now that I could have told her everything that had taken place and she would not have been surprised, having guessed as much already from the signs upon my body. However, her interest chilled me, and I never revealed to anyone what really happened &mdash; until now, of course, and I have no knowledge of you, to whom I send this sad missive from what may well be the ancient past. But I sense you; I know that you are there; I feel your presence, if that is the right word, however light or indistinct the impression you make upon my consciousness. I have decided to confide in you, as I have done with no one else, since not one among those now living, in this world, can be trusted in anything. I am myself the paragon of this precept. Take heed, if you can.   I was yet young, and in time my body healed under the doctor's medication and the nurse's calm proficency; my spirit as well gained strength under the persistent effect of my friend's sunny hopefulness. Before long I could walk again, and soon thereafter was told I was well enough to leave the infirmary. My friend &mdash; against advice, I later learned &mdash; brought me to stay with him at his home. Shortly after this, I received word from my employer, asking after my health and inviting me to call on him. I was apprehensive about this reunion: he had not visited me in the infirmary, nor had he sent any message to me, though he must have heard the story &mdash; I was certain the entire city was abuzz with it, though my friend tried to shield me from rumors and gossip as best he could. The interview was worse than I imagined it would be. With difficulty my employer told me that he could not keep the promise he made to me when he granted my leave of absence &mdash; that I should be able to return to his service whenever I was ready. I could see how much it cost him, not only to go back on his word, but also to hurt me; he was, as I have said, a kind man, who loved me, or had at one time. His explanation was straightforward, for he was just such a man: after what had taken place, it was unlikely that I would be able to regain my relation of fellowship with the rest of his household, and this potential source of disruption he could not afford, given the sensitive nature of his business, which required as always his complete concentration. I could be certain, he said, that there was no doubt in his mind of my complete innocence in the affair, but he could not speak for the others, upon whose full faith in him he had to rely. I could not bring myself to say another word to him. I do not know why I thought there would ever be a chance for me to return to the life I had known before setting off for that terrible place. That former world, I now understood, had expelled me, as a poison is purged. It was impossible to think of my friend suffering any further on my account, and I realized that the only way to prevent that from happening was to get me away from him. However, this would have to be accomplished in such a way that he could accept it, and not do anything foolishly gallant to try to keep me from leaving. My death might have solved the problem neatly, for him at least, but I'm glad to say that, even in deepest grieving over my lost world, I was unwilling to give the right-thinking people, who now included my former employer, the opportunity to use me as a bogle with which to frighten their children into obedience. Yes, the demon conjured by my unjust punishment at the Retreat House still very much wanted this story to continue, and would not be satisfied to let it stand as a mere cautionary tale. And there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life (to resurrect that most ancient saying of the Remnant): a story has an ending, which may or may not edify; in our life, there are no endings, only arrivals and departures. My consciousness may fall asleep for a time, but it will awaken in you, when you read these words. What I think of as myself is merely a meeting place, where ghosts come together for a while to converse, then go their several ways, having exchanged whatever they came here to pass along.   In the end, my beloved's employer forced the issue, by appointing him to take charge of his interests in a distant city. At first my friend tried to refuse this promotion, but was informed that the only alternative was dismissal. It was very difficult for me to convince him to take this assignment, for my friend was proud, and felt he was being treated like a child. But I finally persuaded him by telling a lie: that I myself had received a call from a remote outpost of the Conference, and had accepted it. He was hurt by this, but I told him I was unwilling to be his kept thing, generous and loving as he had always been to me: I must go my own way. I will not speak ill of him; he saved my life and never failed in his tender concern for my welfare. But I saw in that moment that he was relieved, when I released him from his unspoken vow to me, that he would not be required to break faith with his employer, who was indeed like a loving father to him. As for his employer, I have no doubt whatsoever that his only motivation was to rescue his prized protégé from a calamitous entanglement: although he had never met me, he recognized me as a person best kept away from.   I can testify to the truth of yet another saying of the Remnant, that love is sweetest on the eve of departure. But at the very moment my beloved's conveyance finally passed out of sight, this saying came to me, and suddenly I knew that I was the one who had been set free.","TheRetreatHouse.html"],

	["The scriptor and his beloved","One of my fellow scriptores startled me this morning by asking why I do what I do. I first thought he meant the tasks my master sets me, but that is what we all do: obey our masters' commands &mdash; no other reason need be asked. As he continued to look at me, however, I could see that he meant something else, and immediately feared that he had somehow discovered my secret work here in the archives. I responded by looking puzzled, at which he replied, 'No, of course we all perform the work our masters command, but you seem to enjoy your labors. What pleasure can you get out of all that copying, notating, linking? It's intolerably boring; worse, it's trivial. Who will ever read any of it? And our masters themselves are slaves to the same pointless donkey work. All we learn from them is how to waste our lives!' We all laughed at the truth of this, but also because the fellow in question is newly in love, and therefore belittles any exertion that keeps him from his beloved. The rest began to tease him on this account, which he endured as best he could. But the question made me think: not why do I do what I do, but what am I really doing? What is it about the unquestionable drudgery of my work that yet gives me such joy in it? The answer, I came to see, lies in the devotion that impels both me and my amorous colleague to bear, even to treasure our longsuffering for the sake of what we love &mdash; or rather, whom we love. I know not what humble gifts my friend fashions for the object of his devotion, but in my case, every word I copy or passage I notate or link to its distant cousin in another writing is a gift I prepare for my beloved, the reader who someday may pick up this old writing and become absorbed in it. I want that person, unknown to me in every other way, to share my excitement; I want to give that person the liveliest pleasure &mdash; to be ravished by something bright and right and beautiful for the first time.","Thescriptorandhisbeloved.html"],
	["The Starling","When she was young, the Starling was given charge of a stranger who became lost in the mountains where her people lived. While gathering mushrooms in the forest, she heard the piteous cries of a wounded animal. Thinking that her brothers and uncles would be pleased with her if she helped them bring home good meat &mdash; and might even one day let her go hunting with them &mdash; she followed the sound to discover what animal it might be. By and by she came to the brink of a deep ravine, and there, down at its murky bottom, lying partway in the stream, she perceived the form of the largest man-creature she had ever seen. The hair on his head was the shade of birch leaves in autumn, and his strange clothing, once brightly colored, was torn and filthy from much wear in the weather. He lay on his back, with one leg bent out in a way that a leg does not bend without breaking. Studying the marks of his trail in the earth, she quickly perceived what happened: while climbing down the opposite bank, the creature lost his footing and started to slide, and so tried to leap across to a ledge on her side of the ravine. But the ledge was too narrow and he hit it too low, and, after hanging for some time by the fingers of one hand, he lost his hold and fell like a spinning leaf to the bottom. His voice was weakening; it was late in the day; he would certainly be dead before morning. The Starling pondered what to do. At last she descended to the ledge from which the creature had fallen, tore a square from the corner of her apron, and placed a handful of mushrooms within it. Then she measured and cut a length of her line, one end of which she fastened to a sturdy root projecting from the bank. At the other end, she tied up the mushrooms in a bundle, and lowered it over the ledge until it hung just within the creature's reach. Believing it best not to be seen, she climbed back up to the top of the bank, and, hiding behind the trunk of a mighty oak, gave a cry as of a great bird of prey. Then she ran away.","TheStarling.html"],

	["They're coming apart","They're coming apart... The worlds... Last night &mdash; or this morning, rather, just before dawn &mdash; I dreamt I was at a banquet with all my dearest ones. A celebration, a reunion, long overdue. We sat around the big table in the parlor upstairs, that stood like an altar on the dais, where speakers gave their lectures in this ruin's former life. It had been so long since we were all together, I was bursting with love for them, I could hardly bear to keep silent and still, I longed so to gather them in my arms, crush every one of them to my chest &mdash; you know the feeling, you can't ever get them close enough &mdash; but of course I couldn't do that, it would have been unseemly, embarrassing to them, even if they felt the same about me, and not all of them did, I was pretty sure. The easiest way to express what happened next would be to say, 'When I woke up, I could still feel them with me.' But that's not what happened. What happened is that nothing happened that isn't happening all the time: I didn't wake up; I'm the same man now that I was in the dream; the dream didn't end. I got up from my bed, such as it is; I wrapped my blanket around me and climbed what's left of the stairs, edging around the great hole where the floor's collapsed, and crept into the same room I was dreaming about, that's not even a room any more, filled with rubble and trash and with the roof fallen in open to the rain and snow and wind, to the sun and the moon and the whole damn sky every moment from now until there isn't a room anywhere &mdash; and they were still there with me: they'd come up the stairs with me, inched down the hall with me; they were with me all the time. Do you see what I'm saying? In the 'world' where these words I'm writing will remain, now, at the time I'm writing them, my Dear Ones are all dead &mdash; or good as, all lost Last Ones like me, dust in the wind, sand on the beach, salt in the sea. But they never left me. Once each one took up lodging in my breast, in the place where a heart ought to be, he never left, she's still there: they are my heart. Honey in the chest.

	["this road","Yesterday one of my resources failed, maybe fatally, and I cannot discover what went wrong. I really can't deal with a major cock-up just now, but unless I do some investigating, I won't know whether to reconstitute the resource (if I can), work around it for the moment, or go without. I've automated a diagnostic that will crawl the whole system and give me some hard figures I can maybe work with, but that will take a day or so to run, and in the meantime I've just lost the equivalent of an arm or a leg, certainly the use of more than one finger. At least I don't have a supervisor breathing on my cowlick, like in the old days. On the other hand, it also means I have no one to turn to if I get stuck. Like now. Well, can't be helped. We proceed on the basis of not enough facts, not enough time, and not enough stuff to work with, son &mdash; as my last boss liked to say, and always with a smirk &mdash; love to get my hands on his throat right now. No trouble deciding what to do in that situation! Here's what matters. Everybody working on this stuff thinks it's one thing, but I know it's not that thing, it's something else. They see what I'm doing, and they say, in effect (though never quite to my face), 'Why would anybody want to do that?' And maybe they're right &mdash; I mean about doing things their way: it works fine, their way, gets some results, some are even interesting. But if any of them asks what I'm doing and I tell them, they get that too-interested note in their voice and they say, 'Really? Fascinating.' And if I have to ask for help! even if I can get them to understand what I want to do, they say, 'Really? Why don't you just (fill in the blank with the first thing any moron would think of)?' and that's as far as that conversation ever gets. I hear that 'Really?' and I really want to kill. Anyway, I don't feel like I have time to keep carping about this &mdash; but then I can't do anything until the diagnostic's run its course. It's a weird place to be. On the one hand, I'm stupefied that they can't see what I'm saying, but on the other hand, if I'm wrong (which I'm not), then I can totally see why they're mystified by my being so stubborn (and occasionally shirty). That is, if things really work the way they think they do (which they don't), then I'm an idiot or a lunatic to keep doing things my way. (Or a poseur &mdash; I know some of them decided that long ago.) And it's not like this isn't an urgent matter. I mean, if they're right (which they're not), then we can all go on doing things their way and things'll be fine just the way they are &mdash; except they'll keep getting better and better! Isn't that what we all want (I hear them asking me, a tinge of annoyance creeping into their little voice)? Meanwhile they're thinking, What's the matter with you, freak? But if I'm right (and I am), things will not be fine just the way they are, and will not keep getting better and better, but worse and worse, until everything falls apart and our grandchildren are living in caves, if they're living at all. Of course I can't say that in front of Certain People, but that doesn't make me wrong. And so it's sometimes hard for me to keep my temper: everybody does things the way they do things only because that's the way everybody does things. Not to get all fussy and pedantic, but that's STUPID...   Diagnostic's done: news is bad. Either my little corner of the world is special (possible; not likely, though) or everybody's having the same problem, or will, very soon. Trouble is, I can't find out (from where I am at this point) which condition is the case. And I can't travel, not with all this gear. And where would I go? I have a backup plan, of a sort, but I don't trust it, and I can't test it: I can only switch over to it, after which the present system (which still works &mdash; sort of) will no longer function. I need to think this through, but there's no time: if I'm going to make the swap, it has to be now &mdash; tomorrow at the latest. I think I see how this will come down, either way, but either way I'm guessing. Just don't say to me, Only one way to find out! &mdash; if you want to keep your teeth.   I remember a poem just now that makes me wish I believed in the deities, just so I could say to them, Bless the person who thought of this: I always knew that one day I would take this road but yesterday I did not know that it would be today. It's the only thing that keeps me going. Puts everything in perspective. Reminds me of the world I'm really living in. Yes. Really.","thisroad.html"],
	["this work","Sisters and brothers, the moment of our life is upon us. Some among us believe that it is already too late, that we can do nothing but bide our time: the enemy is too powerful, his position too strong; if we try to fight him, we will only waste what little we have in a hopeless cause &mdash; worst of all, we will draw his attention to this refuge &mdash; and he will fall upon us and annihilate the last place in the world that is safe from him. For others among us, this inaction is unbearable. To you I say, you are right to be angry, and your impatience is natural: it is the proper response to injustice. But remember what the Remnant say: Anger destroys everything. If we give in to our rage now, we may be able to strike a blow against the enemy, perhaps injure him, even in time overcome and destroy him. But in doing so, I believe, we will become the enemy. We are the Remnant now, and we must survive: continuance of the race depends upon us &mdash; you must feel this, or you would not be here tonight. And if we are to survive, first and most of all we must be wise about ourselves. Bank the coals of your rage, dear ones, use it to fire your resolve to continue, and to prevail. To prevail, I say, not merely to survive. Our cause may seem hopeless, but it will not always be so, if we are wise. However, even being wise is not enough: we must be wily. There are many ways in which we can interfere with our enemy's enterprise, hobble his steps, spoil his designs. It is not possible at present to openly oppose him &mdash; violence against him will only strengthen him against us. Our goal should be to weaken him with many little snags, delayings, deflections &mdash; none so serious as to raise an alarm, but which, taken together, will distract and addle him so that he starts acting against himself, which will aid our designs. Success has made him mad; neither reason nor compassion can reach him now &mdash; his triumph over his own people is complete, or so he thinks. But his exulting in public clearly shows how much he fears losing what he brags he has won. Such madness matched with such power is an awful thing: great suffering will follow. All people, everywhere, are profoundly threatened. We must take every action in our power to preserve the race, even if it does not wish to be saved. To that end, a group of us will leave this shelter tonight, likely never to return, in order to carry out some of those acts of interference and resistance I just mentioned. They are under their own command, and bear with them no instructions from anyone who remains behind. I do not know where they are going, what they will do, nor even who all of them are. They will not report to me or to anyone here. This silence and irrevocable separation is for the protection of us all. We send with them our deepest love and encouragement, and will remember them daily in our meditations and prayers. While they risk their lives for us and for the rest of the race, we will continue to provision this refuge and, most important, welcome the stranger, according to our mission. Together we will prevail, if not in our own persons, then in the persons of those who come after us, for whom we do our work. We will prevail, I say: WE, because there is no one else, and WILL, because we must. I bless you all for being with me now, to continue this work.","thiswork.html"],

Were we alone in danger, we should be able to survive, for a while at least. But we are not the only souls suffering from the evil effects of what has happened in that world. Many were trapped out there when the tide turned, and cannot defend themselves where they are, so they will try to escape. Some will find their way to us. We must be ready for them. The enemy's strength is twofold: he wields great power, and he is driven by rage. Knowing this is our strength. His power is thunder and lightning; ours is flowing water. He only knows how to hit; we know how to heal. He can only lock us up; we can endure. His heart is on fire, but it consumes itself; our heart is at peace, and welcomes others. ======[lacuna?]======   ... many among his followers. They were betrayed, long before now; the fire of their anger burns deep and very hot. Do not contend with them; they want revenge now, even before relief from their suffering. As long as that governs them, you must stay out of their reach. Their suffering is real, and of long standing. However you can, help them, or provide for others to do so. We may never be reconciled with them, but our compassion must encompass all. The time will come when this great enemy will declare himself the Ruler of the World, and when he does, those whom he has misled, who were ensnared by his lies and enchanted by his false promises, may fully realize their mistake, though by then it will be too late to retrieve it. That time will be the most dangerous, for in that moment anything can happen, and no one will be able to keep safe.

Learning to hit the broad side of a barn, as my Pop-pop used to say &mdash; the way we all start. It's hard for him, of course, watching me fail like this. I think he understands what's happening, and he's worried: he has that expression kids get when something's going really wrong, that look that wrings your heart. When you had one. But he's also curious. He touches me now &mdash; puts his hand on my hand, my chest, my face. Not to comfort me, I can tell, but maybe to see if it can account for what's happening to me, or just confirm what he suspects. Not much else to leave him: my clothes, my tools & weapons, this notebook &mdash; and, if he has any sense, my carcass...","whattoleavebehind.html"],

I was the most rebellious of his disciples, he often told me, as he lay the switch across my bottom. The others feared his temper, but once I perceived that it was the blaze of his vocation bursting out, my heart caught fire from his. When I was but a youth, he sent me into the west, on a mission of reconciliation to several of our young outpost communities. Divisions had arisen there concerning certain matters of doctrine, and my master's message was intended to reconcile them, specifically to enjoin them to reject all deviants from the true way. My master was a loving man, but intolerant of views other than his own. May his spirit forgive me, I can no longer remember what the original disagreement was, but I have no trouble recalling how vicious and destructive it had already become by the time I arrived, and how wrangling over it eclipsed every other concern. I believed I was an excellent disputer, but quickly found that a mere facility with words would not suffice in debate against the brilliant heretics in that area who had bewitched many of our fledgling faith. Fortunately, despite my years, the authority I bore as legate from my master helped me begin to calm the roil of dissension by establishing a kind of tribunal: I persuaded the adversaries to formally present their claims, whereafter I would submit them in a letter to my master, and he would render judgment. But before the tribunal could be convened, devastating news arrived from the east: my master was dead. Worse were the reports of how he left this life. Soldiers of the Golias broke down his door in the middle of the night, dragged him from his bed, tortured him savagely, then presented him to the mob in the arena the next day, where he was stripped naked, impaled on a stake, and burned alive. He was ninety years old. I was ready to set out that very day to return to my home, but the elders of the community pleaded with me not to leave them, saying first of all that there was nothing I could do for my master, and second that I would put myself in danger of coming to the same end. What convinced me to stay, however, was their manifest love for me, their anxiety for my safety and well-being, and &mdash; most damning of all for me, for it most fed my pride &mdash; their desire that I should take my master's place as their spiritual leader. Just then a similar persecution erupted in a nearby city, where the leader of what my master certainly would have regarded as a heretic sect was also arrested, tortured, and publicly executed. His followers fled to our town, where, rather than being given shelter and succor by our congregation, they were driven away, into the wilderness, lest the inquisitors of the Golias find them among us and massacre us all. I was appalled. I vigorously remonstrated with my hosts for their shocking lack of charity towards our wayward brethren, and shamed them into going after the refugees to bring them back. But they could not be found, then or ever again. It was plain to everyone that something had to be done to unite our quarrelsome communities, and once again the idea of a tribunal to settle all points of doctrinal antagonism was put forth; some even proposed that I sit as arbiter, but I did not yet hold myself in such high regard that I could accept that honor and responsibility. Instead, I proposed that we gather our concerns in a petition to the Eparch in Golia, and place ourselves under his authority, in hope to gain such protection as he might have power to extend over us. This plan met with approval, although the composition of the letter itself proved to be as contentious as any credal dispute. In the end, however, the petition was finished, and once again the elders of the community turned to me to act for all of them, by delivering it to the Eparch myself. Why did it never occur to me that this early success might prove my undoing in the end? Because it is always easier to learn the hard way, as the Remnant say: those who prove lucky at the beginning of an enterprise are deprived of the wisdom that a painful lesson can bring, and those who have no experience of the brutal reversals that life can inflict cannot appreciate how quickly and utterly their good fortune can turn into its opposite. I was just such a creature then. Young, intelligent, articulate, and seemingly wise in penetrating the motives of human beings &mdash; when in fact I was merely cunning in debate. I knew many things, but I understood nothing. In any case, I took the step I took, and it may be that, had I been wiser then, I would not be here now, where I belong. But O what suffering I caused! What awful, irretrievable wreckage I created! I cannot believe that that was necessary, just to teach me a lesson. But these are pointless maunderings, as I well know, having agonized over them again and again. Best to finish the story, if I can. For so powerful a personage, at least among our community of believers, the Eparch was, as a man, modest and mild. He listened sympathetically to my introduction, read the petition carefully, and then questioned me closely about the events that led up to my bringing it to him. He also spoke in sorrow about the vile murder of my master, and told me of their friendship, which, though attenuated by distance, was deep and abiding. But on the subject of my mission, he was evasive &mdash; indeed, he seemed not to comprehend the severity of our distress. He explained to me that in his own flock, there was considerable variation of opinion on the finer points of doctrine; heresy was less of a problem than avoiding the agents of the Inquirer General, whose charge it was to ensure the proper reverence for the Deities, by whose authority the Golias was said to rule. This was accomplished by not attracting too much attention, and by meeting informally in each other's homes to celebrate our faith. In Golia itself there had been no serious persecution in years, he said, and if the occasional loudmouth got himself dragged off by denouncing the gods or calling the Golias a damned soul, this often inspired as much relief as outrage among the congregations. On the other hand, he did agree to send a letter back with me addressing each of our concerns, and assuring us of any assistance he could supply in the future. With that, he kindly but firmly ushered me out, saying he hoped that I could occupy myself in the city for a day or two until he could compose his response. When that was ready, he would send for me. At first I was at a loss to pass the time. There were many diversions in the city for those who have nothing better to do than to waste their substance in riotous living, but though today I can see a kind of wisdom in living like a flame, I have never had the taste or the talent for that kind of life, and at the time I was very censorious, as is the way with all young zealots, especially those who have been encouraged by the seeming approval and admiration of their elders. I'd been given lodging with the relatives of a family in our congregation, a pious elderly couple who lived a quiet life in an out-of-the-way part of the city. Upon returning to their home for the evening meal, I found waiting for me in the courtyard a man of my own age who introduced himself as their son, and who persuaded me to forego the humble fare of his parents' table and accompany him to a friend's abode, where we would dine with other members of the faith that I might otherwise not have a chance to meet. The residence of this friend of my hosts' son was near the center of the city, in an area of broad streets lined with magnificent dwellings. Into one of these we went, and I was immediately swept up into an experience that utterly changed me, and stood as the moment of my life, to use the Remnant's formulation, until the day of my conversion &mdash; the day that brought me to you, little children. =====[lacuna]=====   It did not take long to discover the heart of the festivity. In the large central room, where a robust fire was burning, a space had been cleared just beside the hearth, and there a performance was taking place &mdash; some kind of recitation, or so it seemed at first. A handsome well-built man with shaggy blond hair was speaking in an animated fashion, apparently re-enacting a comical conversation between two people he had overheard, or perhaps had composed himself for the entertainment of others, and in which he was succeeding definitively. I, too, could not resist joining in the laughter, until I finally penetrated the strange accent this man affected for the more ridiculous of the two characters he portrayed. I realized that he was mocking the Eparch himself, and the source of most of his humor was the satirical twisting of statements of our creed, which he mangled in such a way as to make them completely ludicrous. I looked around the room, and saw that only two people were not convulsed with hilarity at this man's japings: my new friend, who, while smiling himself, kept glancing at me nervously, and another somewhat older man near the side of the performing area, who was regarding me with dark shining eyes. He nodded to me slightly, then returned his attention to the performance, which was nearing its climax. With a fine thumping phrase, the animated artiste sent the crowd into an explosion of laughter and cheering, during which he bowed and capered about, then sat pertly next to the man with the dark eyes, who clapped him around the shoulder and clasped his hand. I was ready to quit the city then and there, with or without the letter from the Eparch, and started to ask my new friend to take me back to his parents' house at once, but the noise was too great to make myself understood. And then the host of the gathering interrupted to tell me that another of his guests wished to meet me. Although I was anxious to leave, my friend and our host made it clear that I really was not at liberty to decline. And so I was led into the presence of the son of the Golias, the man with the dark shining eyes, and his companion, whose name I never learned, but whom the young Golias called his Historian. Both men regarded me with frank interest, and the encounter was also a matter of curious attention from a few other guests, though beyond the periphery of our little circle, the raucous party resumed. The son of the Golias said he perceived that I was not entirely captivated by his Historian's performance. I replied that I was not a qualified judge, being an outlander and unfamiliar with such matters. He asked how I'd come to be in the city, and I gave a guarded reply, that I'd been sent by associates to conduct some business on their behalf. 'My friend,' he said with a smile, ' &mdash; and I hope you will honor me with your friendship? &mdash; I know something of the business that brought you here, and would be glad to help, if I can.' I did not know how to respond, so I merely bowed. 'You seem puzzled, perhaps skeptical. That is wise. What do you know of me, except that the Golias my father persecutes your brethren, torturing and executing them in the arena for the enjoyment of the rabble? But perhaps that policy can be emended. Would that be a good thing?' 'Certainly, my lord.' 'Then I shall see what can be done. But I would be grateful to know what you found offensive in my Historian's performance.' The Historian himself then spoke up, 'I thrive on criticism, you see &mdash; it keeps my skills at their highest pitch.' I looked in his face for the first time. His smile seemed sincere, and his voice sounded friendly. But in his eyes there was a cool light, as if he were sizing me up as an adversary. I returned his gaze as steadily as I could. Perceiving this, the Historian smiled more broadly. 'You were going to say...?' 'It took me some time to recognize the Eparch as the object of your satire,' I began carefully. 'At first I could not understand what he was supposed to be saying.' 'My thoughts exactly,' said the son of the Golias, 'The impersonation was rather crude, my dear.' The Historian conceded the point with a sideways nod of his head. 'My first attempt,' he said. 'Too primitive. I'll work on it.' 'I suspect our young friend here would rather you did not &mdash; am I right?' said the young Golias, turning to me. I stammered, 'The Eparch is a holy man &mdash;' 'The Eparch,' said the Historian acidly, 'is a fussy old matron &mdash;' but the young Golias laid a hand on his arm, and he stopped. 'The kind of man the Eparch is does not matter,' I shot back. 'It is his Mission &mdash;' 'The kind of man anyone is always matters,' the Historian returned, a fire kindling in his eyes. I found it hard to resist this obvious personal challenge. It had been some while since my last battle with another mind, as I so much enjoyed to do in my master's house. But there I had also learned not to enter the fray until I knew something of the terrain. Here I was a stranger, in the presence of one who after all held my life in his hands. The room grew quiet. Our eyes were locked together. I knew that to break this contact, to glance at the young Golias, for example, would be to flinch, and the advantage would go to my opponent, who clearly understood the same. The silence lengthened. Then there was a slight stirring from where the Golias' son stood. The Historian softened his stance, but kept his eyes on me. 'And what kind of man are you, my disapproving young friend? What is the Eparch to you that he calls forth such a fiery defense?' 'Until this day,' I said, as evenly as I could, 'a man worthy only of admiration and respect. What has he done to warrant such contempt from a man so prominently placed as yourself?' The Historian inclined his head slightly to acknowledge that he may have underestimated me, but there was also a kind of warning in his eyes. As I contemplate this moment from the distance of years, I perceive that he was perhaps trying to spare me what would follow if I did not back down now, but of course even if I'd understood this &mdash; and maybe I did, a little &mdash; it would only have fired my self-regard, and I would have done exactly what I did, or worse. In the event, he said, 'Forgive me, but are you saying that the leader of an outlawed cult is worthy of admiration and respect? Does not his very claim to be the so-called Father of the Faith constitute treason against the deities by whose command the Golias rules his people? Is this not a capital offense?' I was staggered. I had assumed I was at a gathering of friends &mdash; if not fellow believers, at least those sympathetic to our ideal. But of course, there was no reason at all for this to be true, as I now realized: how did I know that the young man who called himself the son of my hosts was in fact who he said he was? &mdash; we never entered the house of his 'parents' together. Had his unexpected appearance been a snare laid to have me arrested? Had I been drawn into this very argument in order that I might expose myself to my enemies? Even were that the case, I thought, my fate was likely already decided, and there would be no shame in dying a martyr to the cause. Or so I believe now must have been my reasoning then. In truth, I'd tasted this man's blood, and though he'd wounded me in return, I was now intent on finishing him off, or at least bringing him down with me when I fell. 'As he is under the sentence of death,' I said, 'he merits your compassion, not your ridicule. It is like jeering at a legless man because he cannot walk.' At this moment the young Golias gave a shout of laughter, startling us both and everyone around us as well.","WritingsoftheMissionary.html"],
	["Young Robenc","When Robenc was a young man, his first official assignment was Phylax of the small garrison at Mountain House. Politically, the position was hardly a plum appointment, the locale being so remote (in so many ways) from the Golias' court. But he was young, with enough ambition to get him into trouble with his betters, and it was his first command. His primary duty, it seems, was to preside over the five Stratioti, who did all the work, to take a quarter-day shift in rotation with them, and of course, to secretly report on the Superius Frater's doings from time to time. Otherwise, there really was very little to do, so in his off hours he would wander the demesne, getting to know the trails, the cutoffs, the ways into and out of the grounds, and the general layout of the House itself. He had started these excursions while slipping away to the town, but soon became fascinated with the terrain &mdash; its stately mountains, sheer drops, boulder fields, and magnificent vistas. Two things ripened in his mind on these ramblings. One was that even were he not duty-bound to the Frater and his own men, he might well choose to live out here, well away from the city's noise and intrigue. The other was a sense, inchoate at first, and unsupported by any direct evidence from his senses, that someone was living out there in the wild surrounding the House. His walks in the woods and mountains took on the character of a kind of hunt: without knowing it at first, he began to use instincts developed during his military training to 'stalk' his indistinctly imagined quarry. By the time he became consciously aware that he was doing this (he was not a man given to much reflection), he was taking every moment of his free time &mdash; and some of his working hours as well &mdash; to track this person or persons unknown. This preoccupation of Robenc's caused some worry on the part of the Superius Frater. He did know, of course, that Robenc was sent in part to spy on him, and would have to report to their common superiors from time to time. He also knew that he himself was doing nothing out of the ordinary, at least at the moment, to occasion Robenc's frequent visits to the town. The Frater tried subtly to find out more from the stratioti, but they did not seem to care what Robenc did. To them the Phylax was a likable but not very bright sort of person who liked tromping through the woods. Most of their conversations with him concerned the beauty of the surroundings, a subject about which he seemed unendingly enthused, and which led them to treat him with a touch of indulgence: he was, after all, a city boy who had never seen such things. The Frater of course recognized this as a ploy on Robenc's part for getting information from them without their realizing it. But about what? The countryside, and the house, and the legends about the place that nobody really believed but loved to tell? What was Robenc up to? He decided to ask Robenc directly. It was a gloomy day in midwinter. The lake was frozen, but a few days before, it had warmed up enough to slush the trails and walks. Then during the night freezing rain had turned everything as slick as a mirror. It was still falling after breakfast when he found Robenc on the lower porch, pacing to and fro as if on a leash. The Frater ordered bark tea from the refectory, and when it came he opened the window of his study and invited Robenc in. The young man appeared reluctant, but when the Frater remarked that the rain was unlikely to let up whether Robenc stood watching it or not, he shrugged with a faint smile and came in. Robenc accepted the glass of tea with a distracted air and waited for the Frater to make whatever request he had decided to make. 'When I was first sent here,' the Frater began, 'I was aggrieved and resentful. I felt I had been exiled to the end of the world, and spent my days plotting my escape. But you seem delighted by this remote assignment. Perhaps &mdash; ' [...]","YoungRobenc.html"]
