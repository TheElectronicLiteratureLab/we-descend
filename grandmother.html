			<p>Very early this morning, after a restless night, I went out and sat apart from the group, watching the
				stars fade <a id="atticroom">as I had loved to do</a> <a href="stars.html#atticroom">in my attic
					room</a> in the town. <a id="grandmother">In a while</a>, <a href="fog.html#grandmother">the
					grandmother</a> came out of the scraggly thicket where the rest were still sleeping, and sat, not
				close, but a little beyond arm's reach, like a stranger at an otherwise empty caf&eacute;, near enough
				to start a conversation, if one of us wanted to, but far enough that it wouldn't be necessary, if
				neither of us did.</p>
			<p>We faced west, watching the distant hills begin to stand out from the black sky, a few thready clouds
				lazing near their tops as they pinked up, <a id="sunlight">as if coming back from the dead</a>. In a
				moment, <a href="keepingbusy.html#sunlight">sunlight began to melt like honey down the mountain's
					flank</a>. Presently I heard what I thought was wind moving across the moor before us, but then
				realized she was humming, and <a id="rocking">out of the corner of my eye I perceived</a> that <a
					href="Starlingredux.html#rocking">she rocked, like someone mourning</a>.</p>
			<p>The sound and motion penetrated me, and I began rocking as well, the grief for all I've lost forever
				rising powerfully in me, but I forced it back down with an impatient gesture, and she instantly went
				silent and still.</p>
			<p>I felt she had turned, and when I looked, I saw her regarding me, head tipped to the side, with what
				might have been a small smile. She nodded once, then turned her gaze back toward the brightening
				mountains. She rocked a few more times, then looked down and spoke gently.</p>
			<p>Of course I did not comprehend all she said, but I recognized the word that I think means 'outlander'
				&mdash; the word they use for me &mdash; though she seemed to be applying it to herself, or using it in
				a way that didn't involve me. <a id="stranger">Perhaps she too had been</a> <a
					href="fog.html#stranger">a foreigner among these people</a> at one time &mdash; but then sooner or
				later all of us find ourselves a stranger among strangers, do we not?</p>
			<p>Whatever she was saying, it was a story, as I recognized, and I nodded or murmured when the music of her
				telling invited me to do so, and when the tale was over, and she looked up to see if I understood, I
				smiled, because I did understand, if not her text, then the feeling she imparted in conveying it to me
				&mdash; the weight of its meaning, if not the meaning itself, and she saw she had reached me, and smiled
				in return.</p>
			<p>The others were stirring; she looked towards them, then got up and, as she passed, put a hand on my
				shoulder &mdash; I couldn't tell whether she wanted me to stay behind because she did not want us seen
				together, or was only telling me I could keep my watch a little longer if I wished, so I remained in
				place, returning my gaze to the now brilliant landscape, <a id="atpeace">feeling all at once</a> <a
					href="deities.html#atpeace">at peace</a>, a creature in a world again.</p>
