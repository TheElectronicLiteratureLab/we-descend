			<p>Some dispute the authenticity of this second clause, and surmise its insertion by a later hand, perhaps
				by way of urging the attribution of this Writing to the <a href="LegomenonforLASTONE.html"><strong>Last
						One</strong></a>. This imputation of chicanery is itself suspect, and not only for being inane
				and redundant: yes, it is true that anybody familiar with the Archives will have no trouble making the
				association with the Last One here, with or without the explicit arraignment of the ghosts. However,
				there is no telling how, in the many stories told in the Archives, such an anybody might begin to gain
				this level of familiarity, and so it is always best to assume that what may be well known to oneself is
				not necessarily so to anyone else.</p>
