			<p>Once, in the middle of the night, she came to me. It was early in my convalescence, a terrible time when
				all my injuries fully manifested themselves, and their treatment often entailed the most exquisite
				agony.</p>
			<p>The doctor explained that my spine had been bruised, and the nerves were swelling in such a way that I
				felt first a tingling, then a burning, and finally a bone-deep ache down both arms, shoulder to
				fingertips. It would heal of itself, he told me, but it might be a long time, perhaps months, before I
				could use my hands normally again.</p>
			<p>I had been given an anodyne at bedtime, but its effect faded long before it should have, leaving me
				writhing on my cot. I may have cried out for help; certainly my groaning and thrashing disrupted the
				sleep of the few others in the dormitory.</p>
			<p>I got up and went out into the day room, with the intent of walking off the pain if I could. Not
				surprisingly this brought little relief, and may have made matters worse. But there was no point in
				returning to bed, and pacing back and forth at least gave me something to do.</p>
			<p>After a long while, there appeared, in the dim light beyond the threshold of the surgery, a figure in a
				long robe and hood. The shape moved closer, and I backed away, uncertain if I had invoked some demon of
				the night to torment me further, or else the Companion had come to conduct me out of this world.</p>
			<p>But then the hood was drawn back <a id="nurse">to reveal the face of</a> <a
					href="HistoriansNotebook.html#nurse">my nurse</a>, her hair unfastened, eyes still puffy from sleep.
				Somehow, I had never thought to picture her as an ordinary soul who wore a night dress in order to sleep
				in a bed, and the look that must then have crossed my face seemed to cause her own expression to soften
				towards me in that moment.</p>
			<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
			<p class="dictation">Patient is a gifted storyteller, and indulges this gift at every opportunity. But there
				is no possibility that the dreadful wounds sustained by this young person are self-inflicted. The true
				events and conditions issuing in these injuries are of no concern to me or to the doctor, except insofar
				as our knowing them can help us do our work. Still...</p>
			<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
			<p>She led me into the surgery, where she lit a fire under the kettle. I could only gaze at her, unable to
				speak, <a id="barktea">as she went about preparing an infusion</a> of <a
					href="ScholarsApologyredux.html#barktea">bark tea</a>. When it was ready, she opened a cabinet with
				a key suspended from a sturdy but beautiful chain around her neck, and took out <a id="potion">a tiny
					bottle with a glass stopper</a>; <a href="TestimonyofPraetorAric.html#potion">to the potion she then
					added a single drop from the phial</a>, which she replaced and locked securely in the cabinet again.
			</p>
			<p>The tea was bitter, but had a wholesome aftertaste that spread warmth through my body as if I were being
				lowered into a hot bath. The nurse smiled to see my reaction, her face still gentle from recent rising.
				Soon the pain lost its savage sharpness, and I was able to move my arms with some ease again. She asked
				if I was ready to go back to sleep; I replied that I was exhausted, but also felt reluctant to disturb
				my fellows in the dormitory with my restless noise.</p>
			<p>She appeared to consider for a moment, then took my hand and opened the door to what I'd thought must be
				a linen closet, and indeed the room beyond was tiny. But against the far wall was a true bed &mdash; not
				a cot or hammock &mdash; rough-hewn and small, but with a mattress and two pillows in addition to the
				bedclothes which she had recently thrown aside to come to my relief.</p>
			<p>It was an uncertain moment: her generous gesture could so easily have been misinterpreted, were anyone to
				learn of it, but I do believe there was more to her intention than professional concern for my comfort.
				There was also no danger of impropriety, on my part at least, given the condition of my injuries.</p>
			<p>So I lay down upon her bed, and sank into the warmth of her smell as she covered me with her blankets and
				went to sit at the little desk out in the surgery, where she opened a ledger and began to write by the
				light of a candle. In moments I must have fallen asleep, and the next morning awoke upon my cot in the
				dormitory, knowing nothing of how I had returned thither.</p>
			<p>In the days that followed, I saw more than once that same measuring look in her eyes as she attended the
				doctor's examination of his patients. This led me to believe that what I had experienced that night was
				no mere vision of delirium, and in time this impression was confirmed when she asked me, as she changed
				my pillowslip after just such a visit from the doctor, if I was still having difficulty sleeping. I
				responded that the single application of her potion &mdash; or perhaps her unexpected kindness &mdash;
				had been enough to banish my sleeplessness ever since, and indeed the only dreams I remembered were
				suffused with calm joy.</p>
			<p>I saw that it took some effort for her not to smile, but she was clearly not a person much susceptible to
				flattery. She said she was happy to hear it, then chaffed me solemnly that I should continue to dream so
				if I could.</p>
			<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
			<p class="dictation">Patient's suffering lessens day by day; the question now arises: How long...?</p>
			<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
			<p>I cannot escape the feeling that my nurse is waiting for me to say or do something &mdash; or for some
				development in my condition that has yet to take place. The latter would be the logical explanation for
				this feeling; but I somehow believe the former is the case. If so, I am unsure what it is she wants from
				me.</p>
			<p>Our midnight meeting has not been repeated, though more than once I have long lain awake, trying to
				decide whether to get up and go to the day room again, to see if she would reappear as before. I have
				not done so, of course; I feel it would be dishonest: my pain no longer agonizes me; indeed, my
				medication has been reduced with no ill effect.</p>
			<p>In a short while, I know, I will be released, and go on to whatever life I can make for myself in what
				remains to me of the world I was driven from that night.</p>
			<p>This notion makes me think that perhaps I am waiting for something from her: but what? a valediction?
				some kind of blessing upon the journey I must now take? She knows what was done to me &mdash; that much
				can be deduced from my injuries. It would hardly be difficult <a id="lonesurvivor">for a thoughtful
					person to wonder how I came to be</a> <a href="TheKindsofWildernesses.html#lonesurvivor">the only
					survivor</a> of that annihilation.</p>
			<p>How could such a wretched creature as myself expect any blessing from anyone, ever again, let alone from
				the angel of mercy she is to me?</p>
			<p>And yet, I realize, that is exactly what I await from her.</p>
			<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
			<p class="dictation">Patient's injuries are healing well, but a pall of sadness and anxiety seems to have
				taken hold of this poor young person. I fear that unless something is done to relieve this burden, no
				combination of medicaments will bring about a recovery.</p>
			<p class="dictation">This spiritual affliction is not uncommon in those who survive when others around them
				perish; if that is so in this case, it will not be within our power to effect relief &mdash; rather,
				such persons must turn away from sorrow of their own accord.</p>
