			<p>The mirror. A device built purposely to give us Ourself.</p>
			<p>In it we see an image, a representation that has no material connection to us, nor to any other being.</p>
			<p>The measure we take of what we see in the mirror implicates no one else, no thing else; it abstracts, projects, perpetrates an Other of Ourself, which we then contemplate.</p>
			<p><a id="thatfoolishboy">It does not make us love ourself</a>, as with <a href="thatfoolishboy.html#note">that foolish boy</a> <a id="inlove">leaning over the drifting stream</a>, <a href="stars.html#inlove">in love with loving</a>, as when we were young, so long ago &mdash; we know the face in the stream is not real: we can see the minnows swim through it.</p>
			<p>No: that was not our need. We needed an appliance. To capture the image alone, house it in a frame, <a id="gear">so we can bring it with us</a>, <a href="awake.html#gear">in our gear</a>.</p>
			<p>What we see there is only beauty, utterly enchanting &mdash; and no meat, with its mess, its smell, its rot.</p>
			<p>Yes, ourWorld is there, in the mirror, if anywhere...</p>
