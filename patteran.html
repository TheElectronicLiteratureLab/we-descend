			<p>my little boat and I drift along<br>
			as the morning sun hatches</p>

			<p>through cascades of pine and early<br>
			oak, past tumbling ravine-mouth</p>

			<p>and solemn lagoon, and then enter<br>
			a pool, whose one high bank looks across</p>

			<p>to a tidy beach of pebbles, each a different<br>
			shade of silver gray. <a id="asmallpyramidofsharperstones">Atop the taller side</a>,</p>

			<p><a href="asmallpyramidofsharperstones.html#note">a small pyramid of sharper stones</a> rises,<br>
			a monument stacked to a knee-high point</p>

			<p>in memory of some lost sage or suicide,<br>
			and I stop and paddle back, then spy</p>

			<p>a path-head just beside the pile, which itself bears<br>
			no inscription. I tie the boat to keep it company,</p>

			<p>and climb into the forest, then up<br>
			and up, winding back and forth across</p>

			<p>an ever steeper slope. Even the pines<br>
			give out before the trail does, and soon</p>

			<p>I find a tunnel into the rocky<br>
			shoulder the mountain turns to me,</p>

			<p>impassable any other way. Inside,<br>
			the grotto roof is bloody red,</p>

			<p>but no story arises to explain, and so,<br>
			when the cave opens out at its other end, I</p>

			<p>climb on, and push and drag my ancient<br>
			bones with feet and hands along the path</p>

			<p>and then, at last, with elbows<br>
			and knees. On a broad plateau,</p>

			<p>a rocky meadow sprouting tufty<br>
			weeds like an old man's beard</p>

			<p>welcomes me to rest, and I lie<br>
			on my back, and gasp and laugh</p>

			<p>at my aged body that still<br>
			believes it is young, poor fool.</p>

			<p>A fool but a happy one, it corrects me,<br>
			and I'm happily reproved. Up here,</p>

			<p>the sky surrounds all, rinsing<br>
			rocks and weeds and one old man</p>

			<p>with brilliant light and a cool spring breeze,<br>
			then drying us all with bright whitest cloud.</p>
