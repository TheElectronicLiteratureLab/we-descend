			<p>It is the time of a major festa here in my adopted town: last night the street from which my little lane
				branches was closed off by bonfires built at each intersection, which allowed people on foot to come in
				but kept all other traffic out. Between the two fires, next to a doorway, a small shelter was built
				against the wall by propping posts in the gutter, tying beams onto and between them with <a
					id="stalks">fibers of straw, then leaning</a> <a href="themoonlitgarden.html#stalks">sheaves of dry
					stalks</a> on the frame to make sides and a roof. This simple structure was then decorated with
				leaves and strings of seedpods, and inside stood three costumed children, about ten years of age, two
				girls and a shorter boy whose little round face was adorned by a beard drawn on with fire-smudge &mdash;
				perhaps he was playing a husband or father. My neighbors gathered round them, chanting, and every moment
				more people came and joined in.</p>
			<p>This I watched from my roof, squatting by the stubby chimney, which stands guard over the tiny crossing
				where all this unfolded. The chanting went on for a time, then abruptly its tune changed, and the
				children came out of the shelter, singing a simple melody. The crowd gave a response to each line,
				following as the children turned down the street, then stopped at the first open doorway. There they
				sang a different two-line phrase, and two or three voices responded from inside, then the incantation
				went back and forth three times between the two groups. Finally the children turned away, returning to
				the first melody, and the whole procession moved along to the next 'station', where this ritual was
				repeated.</p>
			<p>When the children reached the fire at the far crossing, they led the assembly in a ragged wheeling
				maneuver, and came back in the same manner, stopping at each dwelling along the other side of the
				street, arriving at last at the doorway beside the shelter where the procession began. At this the
				people inside, whom I could see from my perch, brought food and drink out into the intersection. The
				children tore off the costumes they wore over their everyday clothes and ran into the crowd, tussling
				and giggling with their friends, and an impromptu musical consort burst into an energetic dance tune,
				which set everyone laughing and shouting.</p>
			<p>I was charmed, as you can imagine, but also unprepared for the upwelling of homesickness that immediately
				followed. I was unable to hold back insistent tears, and barely managed to stifle a yowl of grief before
				turning away and clambering down to my room.</p>
			<p>Here I have been imprisoned for nearly two days by the tireless revelry that continues in the street
				below, blocking my way out and depriving me of sleep. I can now sing (indeed, cannot stop singing) what
				I imagine to be every ditty, march, drinking song, and love-lament these people seem to know, and of
				which they never weary. The musicians among them have improved noticeably from all this repetition, and
				I would not be surprised to discover that more than one of their number has used this celebration to
				learn to play well an instrument never even tried before.</p>
