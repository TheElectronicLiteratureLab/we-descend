			<p>According to a clearly corrupt but nonetheless plausible variant of this Writing, the Golias himself,
				early in his reign, put down a rebellion in a defiant village in the mountains. When the fighting was
				over, the inhabitants were herded into the town square, whereupon the ringleaders were 'tried' for
				treason, and a sentence of death pronounced upon their alleged captain. Disdaining to carry out the
				sentence himself, the Golias commanded the first able-bodied citizen upon whom his eyes alit to behead
				the man on the spot. That citizen, the town smith, seems to have been this Author's father (or
				grandfather, or great-grandfather).</p>
			<p>From that moment the only employment the former smith or any of his family could find was that of
				executioner, whose duties at the time also comprised non-lethal punishments such as amputation,
				branding, and flogging, as well as the dislocation of joints and breaking of bones &mdash; hence,
				perhaps, the waggish (but frightful) cognomen 'Bone-Snapper'.</p>
