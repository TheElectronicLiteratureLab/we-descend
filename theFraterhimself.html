			<p>Note the inconsistency in the designation of officials attached to this community: throughout <a
					href="EgderusatMountainHouse.html"><strong>Egderus' Testament</strong></a>, the leader of the
				community at Mountain House is referred to as the Superius Frater, whereas here he is merely the Frater.
			</p>
			<p>Several explanations present themselves:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>This does not describe the community of Mountain House, but rather some other community elsewhere;
				</li>
				<li>This describes an earlier, simpler organization of the community of Mountain House;</li>
				<li>The Frater is an official of the community at Mountain House who for reasons unknown is not
					mentioned in the other Writings.</li>
