			<p>Of considerable interest is the modifier here rendered as '[expletive]', a strategy employed elsewhere by (an) unknown Redactor(s) &mdash; extensively so in the Writing {<a href="purpleberries.html"><strong>purple berries</strong></a>}: it would seem that prevailing mores of semantic decorum would have been breached by baldly presenting the specific words the Author originally inscribed (or uttered, in the case of a transcription). The reader should feel free to supply in each case whatever familiar obscenity seems least likely to destroy the sense of the phrase.</p>
