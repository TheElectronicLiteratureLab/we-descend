			<p>In an earlier Writing, {<a href="TheStarling.html"><strong>The Starling</strong></a>}, the being discovered by the eponymous heroine is depicted as 'him' and 'he', but in this sequelic text is called 'the creature' and 'the thing', and is referred to with the indefinite pronoun 'it'. No satisfactory explanation for this anomaly has been put forth, except to make the rather facile surmise that the two Writings had different Authors, which only elaborates the difference without accounting for it.</p>
			<p>Some critics sense a difference in tone between the two texts; be that as it may, the fundamental question behind all this theorizing is: why is this story told in two Writings in the first place? The answer to this important question has yet to be satisfactorily proposed.</p>
