			<p>Considerable comment is made upon the fact that the customary attribution 'as the Remnant say' is not
				prepended to this venerable proverb, as is the case in almost every other instance of such apparent
				quotation in the Archives.</p>
			<p>This elision (or omission) is sometimes accounted for by theorizing that the Writing was cut off just at
				that point, a thesis that opens the door to all manner of excited (but groundless) speculation about the
				circumstances of its composition.</p>
			<p>Need it be said that, as the Remnant (also) say, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence &mdash;
				to (also) provide an unquestionable examplar of standard practice?</p>
