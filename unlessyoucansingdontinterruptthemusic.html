			<p>Considerable comment is made upon the fact that the customary attribution 'as the Remnant say' is not prepended to this venerable proverb, as is the case in almost every other instance of such apparent quotation in the Archives.</p>
			<p>This elision (or omission) is sometimes accounted for by theorizing that the Writing was cut off just at that point, a thesis that opens the door to all manner of excited (but groundless) speculation about the circumstances of its composition.</p>
