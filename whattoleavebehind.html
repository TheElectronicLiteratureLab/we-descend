			<p>I've been going through my things, trying to decide what I want the Boy to have. It won't be long now: the cold has got into my bones, I'm too weak to drag the heavy logs in, or chop them up into smaller ones. The picture frames &amp; sticks of furniture are long gone. One or two shelf-planks are left, but I won't burn the books. There: I'll leave him the books. He'll know what to do with them.</p>

			<p>Not much else to leave him: my clothes, my tools &amp; weapons, this notebook &mdash; and, if he has any sense, my carcass...</p>
